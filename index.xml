</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="3-advertiser-account">3. Advertiser Account</h2>
<p>You can request to establish an Advertiser Account with us by joining the Brave Ads waitlist at <a href="https://brave.com/brave-ads-waitlist/">https://brave.com/brave-ads-waitlist/</a>. We will process these requests at our discretion. If you are selected, you will need to provide us information to establish an Advertiser Account (&quot;Account Information&quot;), including your name and email address. We may ask for additional Account Information at our discretion. The Account Information you provide must be true and accurate. You must promptly inform us whenever your Account Information changes.</p>
<p>When you establish your Advertiser Account, we may provide you with information related to the Services which is confidential. You have confidentiality obligations with respect to this information and these obligations are described in Section 7.</p>
<p>You must maintain the security of your Advertiser Account and promptly notify us if you discover or suspect that someone has accessed your Advertiser Account without your permission. If you permit others to use your Advertiser Account, you are responsible for the activities of such people that occur in connection with your Advertiser Account. You are responsible for providing and maintaining accurate contact information for your Advertiser Account.</p>
<p>If you wish to delete or deactivate your Advertiser Account, you may do so according to Section 16, but note that we may retain certain information as permitted by law, regulation or court order.</p>

<h2 id="4-advertising-content">4. Advertising Content</h2>
<p>You alone are responsible for the ads submitted for the Platform on your Advertiser Account (<em>&quot;your ads&quot;</em>). You must ensure that your ads are truthful, not misleading, comply with all applicable laws, and, when appropriate, backed by scientific evidence. Your ads must also be of a high quality and they must conform to our ad policy (<em>&quot;Ad Policy&quot;</em>), which we provide to you when you establish your Advertiser Account and which is incorporated into these terms. The Ad Policy includes a list of the geographic regions in which Brave Ads are intended to be shown as well as content classifications (<em>&quot;Content Classifications&quot;</em>) (including prohibited classifications). We may update the Ad Policy, including the lists of Content Classifications and regions from time to time. It is your responsibility to review these changes to the Ad Policy on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>You must accurately label your ads with the region(s) in which they are to be shown, and all of the Content Classifications which apply to them. The subject of each of your ads must be legal to advertise, sell, and use in all of the regions with which you label that ad, as well as in the USA, the state of California, and the Cayman Islands. The Content Classifications you select for each of your ads must be accurate and comprehensive. Your classification obligations include without limitation, the content of your ads, their landing page(s), and the overall reputation of your brand and products in the region(s) where your ads are to be shown. You must not submit ads which are in prohibited Content Classifications.</p>
<p>Your ads are subject to review and approval by us before they are activated for delivery in the Platform. We may also review your ads at any point and for any reason. If you fail to correctly and comprehensively label any of your ads with all of the correct Content Classifications, if you post an ad in a prohibited Content Classification, or if your ads for any reason do not pass our approval process, or are otherwise deemed to be in violation of these Terms, we may — at our discretion — disable those ads, immediately halt all of your ads, suspend you from the platform, or apply other remedies we think are needed to ensure the quality and reputation of the Platform. Our determination in these matters, including as to which Content Classifications apply to any of your ads, is final and binding.</p>
<p>You grant a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to Company to reproduce, distribute, publicly display, and modify (as needed for display on the Platform) your ads for the purpose of displaying your ads via the Platform and otherwise providing the Services to you under these Terms.</p>

<h2 id="5-invoicing--payment">5. Invoicing &amp; Payment</h2>
<p>Your ads are priced based on the billable events (<em>&quot;Billable Events&quot;</em>) described in the Brave Ads Rate Card (<em>&quot;Rate Card&quot;</em>) then in effect. The Rate Card is shared with you when you establish your Advertiser Account, and we may update it from time to time. The Rate Card is incorporated into these Terms. When the Brave browser displays one of your ads or processes any other Billable Event, it reports that Billable Event to us. Once we have received a confirmed insertion order from you, you are responsible for all of the Billable Events associated with that campaign. Approximately every month, we verify and tally the Billable Events associated with all of your active ad campaigns and issue you an invoice. Our accounting of Billable Events is final and binding. You agree to pay the full amount of each invoice within 30 days of receipt.</p>

<h2 id="6-taxes">6. Taxes</h2>

Company is not responsible for withholding, collecting, reporting, or remitting any tax arising from your use of the Services. You agree to provide information reasonably requested by Company, including completed and signed tax forms, as applicable.</p>

<h2 id="7-confidentiality">7. Confidentiality</h2>
<p>In the course of your use of the Services, we may disclose to you information which we consider confidential, including without limitation the Ad Policy and the Rate Card. Confidential information (<em>&quot;Confidential Information&quot;</em>) includes any information, details, facts, documents, messages, correspondence, or other material which:</p>
<ol>
<li>we have not previously deliberately disclosed publicly;</li>
<li>we indicate is confidential at the time we share it with you;</li>
<li>is marked as private, confidential, restricted, or with similar indicators; or</li>
<li>you should reasonably conclude we intend to keep confidential.</li>
</ol>
<p>You agree to use this Confidential Information solely for the purpose of exercising rights or fulfilling obligations under these Terms. You also agree to protect this Confidential Information and to keep it secret, using no less than the same degree of care that you use when you protect your own similar confidential information, and in any event at least a reasonable degree of care.</p>
<p>In the event that you receive a valid order from a court or other government body which legally compels you to disclose any Confidential Information, you agree to make every lawful attempt to inform us of the order and to assist us in seeking to narrow the scope of the order, or obtain a protective measure to protect the secrecy of the Confidential Information. But if you are legally prevented from informing us or our attempt to limit the scope of the order unsuccessful, then you may disclose Confidential Information as specifically required by the order.</p>
<p>If you cease to be a Brave Advertiser, you will promptly destroy all copies of Confidential Information in your possession. But your confidentiality obligations will persist so long as you have access to or recall any Confidential Information.</p>

<h2 id="4-contributions">4. Contributions</h2>
<p>Each Brave browser operated by a person who activates Brave Rewards in their Brave browser (a &quot;<em>Brave Rewards User</em>&quot;) from time to time indicates to one of our servers that they wish to contribute BAT to Brave Verified Publisher(s). This indication is made via a privacy-protecting protocol which allows us to calculate the total contributed to each Brave Verified Publisher without knowing which Brave Verified Publisher(s) each Brave Rewards User contributed to. The Brave Rewards User contribution mechanism is described in further detail in the <a href="/user-terms-of-service/">Brave Rewards Terms of Service for Users</a>.</p>
<p>The total amount of Brave Rewards User contributions assigned to each site is calculated approximately every calendar month. Contributions are sent from User Wallets and made available to sites that are Brave Verified Publishers approximately through a process facilitated by Brave and/or third-party wallet providers. This process is typically completed by the 8th day of the following calendar month. For operating the Service, we charge Brave Verified Publishers a fee equal to 5% of the contributions assigned to them.</p>
<p>Assignment of contributions to Brave Verified Publishers will be calculated solely based on our accounting. You will not be entitled to any publisher contributions if you are in breach of these Terms at any point during the time period in which such publisher contributions would have otherwise accrued. You will also not be entitled to receive any publisher contribution immediately following the effective date of your Publisher Account termination or suspension. Publisher contributions may be withheld to reflect or adjusted to exclude any amounts arising from breach of these Terms.</p>
<p>In addition to our other rights and remedies, we may require you to return within 30 days of any publisher contribution, or may elect to deduct from your subsequent publisher contributions, any amounts that were erroneously sent to you in prior periods, including as a result of our later discovery that you were in breach of these Terms during such prior periods. If you dispute any publisher contribution amount sent to you, you must notify us at <a href="mailto:publishers@basicattentiontoken.org">publishers@basicattentiontoken.org</a> within thirty days of receiving any such contribution. If you do not, you waive any claim relating to any such disputed publisher contribution.</p>
<p>You are responsible for any other charges assessed by your Custodian or any other third party in connection with publisher contributions. We are also not a party to, and have no responsibility or liability with respect to, any communications, transactions, interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and any Brave Rewards User.</p>

<h2 id="5-company-contributed-bat">5. Company-contributed BAT</h2>

<h3 id="1-user-growth-pool">1. User Growth Pool</h3>
<p>The User Growth Pool is a pool of Company-owned BAT allocated to encouraging use of the Platform and Services. We may from time to time make <em>UGP Grants</em> available to Brave Rewards Users. UGP Grants allow Brave Rewards Users to use Brave Rewards without adding BAT to their User Wallets. Instead, Company makes contributions to Brave Verified Publishers from the User Growth Pool.</p>
<p>We make UGP Grants for the specific purpose of encouraging the use of the Services to support Brave Verified Publishers whose work Brave Rewards Users appreciate. Any other use of UGP Grants is prohibited. More information about UGP Grants for Brave Rewards Users is in the <a href="/user-terms-of-service/">Brave Rewards: Terms of Service for Users</a>.</p>
<p>When a Brave Rewards User attempts to contribute BAT from a UGP Grant to a Brave Verified Publisher, we may undertake additional analysis to ensure that their contribution is legitimate. We reserve the right to not fulfill a UGP Grant, to prohibit a Brave Rewards User from using UGP Grants, or prohibit a Brave Verified publisher from receiving UGP grants at our discretion, including if we detect attempts to defraud us, to use automated means to use UGP Grants, to use the same UGP Grant multiple times, or to misuse the UGP Grant in any way.</p>
<p>Misuse of grants includes (but is not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) creating Brave Verified Publisher channels without substantial creative content, with the intent to accept UGP Grants via these channels; or</li>
<li>(b) any mechanism that results in a Brave browser contributing a UGP Grant automatically, without a deliberate action by the person using that browser.</li>
</ul>
<p>BAT used as part of our Referral Program also comes from the User Growth Pool.</p>

<h3 id="2-restrictions-on-use">2. Restrictions on Use</h3>
<p>Company will not contribute BAT we own to any person or organization, who in our sole judgement:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) engages in or advocates for violence, online or offline,</li>
<li>(b) directly incites violence against individuals or groups, online or offline, or</li>
<li>(c) directly threatens any person, place, organization or group.</li>
</ul>
<p>BAT we own includes that used for UGP Grants as well as that used as part of our Referral Program which is described in Section 19.</p>

<li><strong>(ii) in no event will the aggregate liability of Company and the Company Parties (individually or jointly), whether in contract, warranty, tort (including negligence, whether active, passive or imputed), or other theory, arising out of or relating to the Program or these Terms exceed the total amount of BAT you have received as publisher contributions.</strong></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>(i) waive your and Company’s respective rights to have any and all Disputes resolved in a court, and</strong></li>
<li><strong>(ii) waive your and Company’s respective rights to a jury trial. Instead, you and Company will arbitrate</strong>
Disputes through binding arbitration (which is the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and binding determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-no-class-arbitrations-class-actions-or-representative-actions">2. No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions.</h3>
<p>Any Dispute is personal to you and Company and will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding. There will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals. Further, a Dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.</p>

<h3 id="3-federal-arbitration-act">3. Federal Arbitration Act</h3>
<p>The enforceability of this Section 14 will be both substantively and procedurally governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (the <em>“FAA”</em>), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.</p>

<h3 id="4-notice-informal-dispute-resolution">4. Notice; Informal Dispute Resolution</h3>

<li>(ii) a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute, and</li>
<li>(iii) the specific relief that you are seeking.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you and Company cannot agree how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the date notice is received by the applicable Party, then either you or Company may, as appropriate and in accordance with this Section 14, commence an arbitration proceeding or, to the extent specifically provided for in Section 14.1, file a claim in court.</p>

<h3 id="5-venue--arbitrator">5. Venue &amp; Arbitrator</h3>
<p>Any arbitration will occur in San Francisco County, California. Arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“JAMS Rules”), which are hereby incorporated by reference. The state and federal courts located in San Francisco County, California will have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.</p>

<h3 id="6-authority-of-arbitrator-exchange-of-information-fees-and-costs">6. Authority of Arbitrator; Exchange of Information; Fees and Costs</h3>
<p>As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the applicable JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have</p>
<ul>
<li>(i) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute, including the determination of whether a Dispute is arbitrable, and</li>
<li>(ii) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.</li>
</ul>
<p>The arbitration will allow for the discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the Dispute. For any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee, and Company will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by Company, Company will pay all JAMS fees and costs.</p>

<h3 id="7-rules-of-jams">7. Rules of JAMS</h3>
<p>The JAMS Rules and additional information about JAMS are available on the <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/">JAMS website</a>. By agreeing to be bound by these Terms, you either:</p>
<ul>
<li>(i) acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the JAMS Rules, or</li>
<li>(ii) waive your opportunity to read the JAMS Rules and any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason.</li>

<p>You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted the Terms by notifying Company via email at <a href="mailto:publishers@basicattentiontoken.org">publishers@basicattentiontoken.org</a>.

People who use the Brave browser may activate the Platform's rewards feature (&quot;Brave Rewards&quot;) for making optional contributions in Basic Attention Tokens (&quot;BAT&quot;) to publishers and for earning BAT for viewing or interacting with advertisements.</p>
<p>These Terms govern the services (the &quot;Services&quot;) that Company makes available to Brave browser users who activate Brave Rewards (&quot;Brave Rewards Users&quot;), including the ability to make BAT contributions, earn BAT from viewing advertisements, and obtain related services through the Platform.</p>

<h2 id="3-activation--deactivation-user-wallet-uphold-wallet">3. Activation &amp; Deactivation, User Wallet, Uphold Wallet</h2>

<h3 id="31-activation">3.1 Activation</h3>
<p>To become a Brave Rewards User, you must activate the Services within your Brave browser, and review and accept these Terms with Company.</p>
<p>When you activate the Services, a BAT user wallet will be created for you in the Brave browser (&quot;User Wallet&quot;) through a third party wallet provider, Uphold, Inc. (&quot;Uphold&quot;). You agree to comply with Uphold's Terms and Conditions, available at <a href="https://uphold.com/en/legal/membership-agreement">https://uphold.com/en/legal/membership-agreement</a>, in connection with your use of the User Wallet. You may be required to complete additional verification steps with Uphold before using certain features of the Services. Company has no responsibility or liability with respect to any disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and Uphold.</p>

<h3 id="32-deactivation">3.2 Deactivation</h3>
<p>You can discontinue being a Brave Rewards User at any time by deactivating the Services in your Brave browser.</p>

<h3 id="33-user-wallet">3.3 User Wallet</h3>
<p>The private cryptographic key needed to authenticate you as the owner of the User Wallet is stored only locally in your Brave Browser. Company has no access to this key and cannot restore or replace it if it is lost. Accordingly, you are strongly advised to take the following precautions, as failure to do so may result in loss of access to your User Wallet:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) maintain the security of your User Wallet by protecting your access to your computer and your User Wallet,</li>
<li>(b) promptly notify us if you discover or otherwise suspect any security breaches related to your User Wallet, and</li>
<li>(c) use the private key backup functionality provided by the Brave browser and safeguard your backup private key file as you would safeguard other important financial information.
Company has no responsibility or liability with respect to your use of your User Wallet, or your inability to use or access your User Wallet, regardless of cause.</li>
</ul>
<p>To contribute to registered publishers (<em>&quot;Brave Verified Publishers&quot;</em>) as a Brave Rewards User, you may add BAT to your User Wallet in your Brave browser. <strong>Once added to your User Wallet, BAT cannot be withdrawn. It can only be used for the purpose of making contributions as part of the Services.</strong> More information about adding BAT to your User Wallet is available at <a href="https://brave.com/faq">https://brave.com/faq</a> and at <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/categories/360001053052-Rewards">https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/categories/360001053052-Rewards</a>.</p>

<h3 id="34-uphold-wallet">3.4 Uphold Wallet</h3>
<p>As of Brave version 0.69, it is possible to verify your User Wallet with Uphold. This links your Uphold account with your Brave Browser, claiming ownership of your User Wallet (a <em>&quot;Verified Wallet&quot;</em>). Once linked, Uphold processes your direct tips as part of your Uphold account. These tips are transfered directly by Uphold: Company is not a party to these transactions, and information about these transactions is transmitted from your Brave Browser directly to Uphold so that they can process said transactions. Your relationship with respect to this Verified Wallet is exclusively with Uphold, not Company, and is governed exclusively by the terms of your agreement with Uphold. Features in future versions of the Brave Browser may integrate or interact with your Verified Wallet. With a Verified Wallet, you are responsible for maintaining exclusive control of your Uphold account. Company is unable to assist you should you fail to maintain exclusive control of your Uphold account or require any other assistance with your Verified Wallet.</p>

<h2 id="4-contributions">4. Contributions</h2>
<p>The Brave Rewards feature in your Brave browser allows you to support the Brave Verified Publishers by contributing BAT to them subject to these Terms.</p>
<p>This feature provides several mechanisms for you to contribute BAT from your User Wallet to Brave Verified Publisher(s). Currently, these mechanisms include automatic attention-based monthly contributions (&quot;Auto-Contribute&quot;) and direct tips (&quot;Tipping&quot;). When you first enable the Brave Rewards feature in your Brave Browser, please familiarize yourself with the these options. You can learn more about how Brave Rewards works in your Brave browser at <a href="https://brave.com/faq/">https://brave.com/faq/</a> and at <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/categories/360001053052-Rewards">https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/categories/360001053052-Rewards</a>.</p>
<p>To use the Auto-Contribute mechanism, you select a monthly total amount of BAT to contribute to the sites you visit. The Brave browser assesses the attention you pay to the sites you visit, according to a reasonable attention metric that Company determines, and assigns your monthly BAT contribution among those sites based on that metric. To use the Tipping mechanism, you select a one-time or recurring amount of BAT to be contributed to a particular site. You can change your monthly Auto-Contribute amount or recurring Tipping amounts at any time in the Brave Rewards pane of your Brave browser.</p>
<p>If you have not verified your User Wallet with Uphold, your Brave browser uses a privacy-protecting protocol to assign your BAT contributions to a site. This protocol is designed to ensure that we know how much BAT has been contributed to each site, without knowing which Brave Rewards Users support which sites, preserving your privacy.</p>
<p>The total amount of Brave Rewards User contributions assigned to each site is calculated approximately every calendar month. Contributions are sent from User Wallets and made available to sites that are Brave Verified Publishers through a process facilitated by our third-party wallet provider, Uphold. This process is typically completed by the 8th day of the following calendar month. For operating the Service, we charge Brave Verified Publishers a fee equal to 5% of the contributions assigned to them.</p>
<p>Sites and content creators must become Brave Verified Publishers in order to receive contributions. If you attempt to contribute to a site that is not a Brave Verified Publisher when the contribution is attempted, that attempted contribution will not be completed at that time. Your Brave browser will periodically check whether the site has become a Brave Verified Publisher. Ninety days after the attempted contribution, if the site is still not a Brave Verified Publisher, your Brave browser will stop checking and cancel the unsuccessful contribution attempt. If the site becomes a Brave Verified Publisher during this period, the contribution will be processed at that time.</p>

<h2 id="5-user-growth-pool">5. User Growth Pool</h2>
<p>The User Growth Pool is a pool of Company-owned BAT allocated to encouraging use of the Platform and Services. We may from time to time make UGP Grants available to you. UGP Grants allow you to use Brave Rewards without adding BAT to your User Wallet. Instead, Company makes contributions to Brave Verified Publishers from the User Growth Pool.</p>
<p>We make UGP Grants for the specific purpose of encouraging your use of the Services to support Brave Verified Publishers whose work you appreciate. UGP Grants are exclusively for use by actual humans using the Brave Browser. Any other use of UGP Grants is prohibited, including attempts to:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) use automated means to accept or make contributions though UGP Grants,</li>
<li>(b) use the same UGP Grants multiple times such as through the use of many copies of the Brave browser, or</li>
<li>(c) use UGP Grants for your own personal enrichment.
When you opt to use a UGP Grant through your Brave browser, the BAT is not sent to your User Wallet. Instead, your Brave browser is given a ticket indicating that we may supplement your contributions to Brave Verified Publisher(s) with a UGP Grant. You have a limited time (typically a few months) in which to contribute to Brave Verified Publishers with a UGP Grant, after which the ticket will expire. When you make a contribution to Brave Verified Publisher(s) with a UGP Grant, we send a quantity of BAT corresponding to the grant amount directly to those Brave Verified Publisher(s).</li>
</ul>
<p>In previous versions of the Brave browser, it was possible to allocate UGP Grants to sites which were not Brave Verified Publishers. Brave servers will maintain these portions of UGP Grants on behalf of unverified publisher sites indefinitely. If we are holding BAT that was previously allocated to a site via a UGP Grant and they become a Brave Verified Publisher, they will receive this BAT as part of their first month of publisher contributions.</p>
<p>When you attempt to contribute BAT from a UGP Grant to a Brave Verified Publisher, we may undertake additional analysis to ensure that your contribution is legitimate. We reserve the right not to fulfill a UGP Grant or prohibit you from using UGP Grants at our discretion, including if we detect attempts to defraud us, to use automated means to use UGP Grants, to use the same UGP Grant multiple times, or to misuse the UGP Grant in any way.</p>
<p>In particular, we will not contribute BAT we own to any person or organization, who in our sole judgement:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) engages in or advocates for violence, online or offline,</li>
<li>(b) directly incites violence against individuals or groups, online or offline, or</li>
<li>(c) directly threatens any person, place, organization or group.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="6-brave-ads">6. Brave Ads</h2>
<p>Brave Rewards includes private ads. When you enable Brave Rewards, these ads provide you with an opportunity to earn BAT. In order to earn in this way:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) You must be using a version of the Brave browser with Brave Rewards and ads enabled.</li>
<li>(b) You must see or interact with one or more ads.</li>
<li>(c) You must be in compliance with these terms, and you must not be suspended.</li>
<li>(d) You must claim your BAT once a month. This claim process may involve a challenge to prove that you are human.</li>
</ul>
<p>If all these requirements are met, you earn BAT based on the specific ads you were shown over the course of the given monthly cycle. You earn BAT equal to approximately 70% of the revenue Company earns from the ad campaigns shown to you. As a convenience, estimated earnings are displayed in Brave Rewards. Your actual earnings may differ from this estimate. We do not guarantee ad earnings until we have verified that the conditions above are met. You must then claim your earnings at the end of each monthly cycle.</p>
<p>Private ads are only available in certain regions, which we may change from time to time. If you're not in one of these regions, ads will not be available in Brave Rewards for you. You may not make any attempt to view ads not intended for your region. You'll only see ads if there are ads in the catalog which match your Brave Rewards profile. For this reason, we don't guarantee that there will be ads available for you, even if private ads are available in your region.</p>
<p>You can support Brave Verified Publishers with the BAT you earn from ads. You will soon be able to withdraw it directly by connecting your User Wallet with a verified Uphold account. This integration is not yet complete in released versions of the Brave Browser.</p>
<p>The Services is designed to protect your privacy, and Company does not learn which ads you saw, only an aggregate of how much BAT you earned. From time to time, ad campaigns may perform differently from our projections and tallies of the ads you've seen or interacted with may be delayed. You may disable ads at any time within your Brave browser.</p>

<h2 id="7-taxes">7. Taxes</h2>
<p>You are responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your use of the Services, and for withholding, collecting, reporting and remitting the correct taxes, if any, to the appropriate tax authorities. Company is not responsible for withholding, collecting, reporting, or remitting any tax arising from your use of the Services.</p>

<h2 id="8-brave-verified-publishers-and-advertisers">8. Brave Verified Publishers and Advertisers</h2>
<p>Company is not a party to and has no responsibility or liability with respect to any communications, transactions, interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and any Brave Verified Publisher or Brave Advertiser. Company has no control over and has no responsibility or liability with respect to Brave Verified Publisher content. Company and has no responsibility or liability with respect to Brave Advertiser content. Company does not have any obligation to investigate or verify the reputation, conduct, morality or criminal background of any Brave Verified Publisher or Brave Advertiser.</p>
<p>While the Brave browser may denote URLs that belong to Brave Verified Publishers, such denotation indicates only that the Brave Verified Publisher is registered with Company and eligible to receive publisher contributions, and not that Company endorses the Brave Verified Publisher. While the Brave browser may display ads from Brave Advertisers, such display indicates only that the Brave Advertiser is registered with Company and eligible to place ads, and not that Company endorses the Brave Advertiser.</p>

<h2 id="9-privacy">9. Privacy</h2>
<p>The information you provide to Brave U.S. via the Brave browser when accessing the Services is subject to the Brave Browser Privacy Policy, available at <a href="https://brave.com/privacy/">https://brave.com/privacy/</a>.</p>

<p>Although the Company server necessarily receives IP addresses from the network in connection with our Services, we discard such IP addresses. We also receive User Wallet addresses and related information from Uphold in connection with our Services, but we delete components of that information that are identifiable to Brave Rewards Users and use the remaining information only to facilitate contributions as part of the Services.</p>

<h3 id="brave-verified-publishers-with-civic-reusable-kyc-will-be-able-to-collect-earned-bats-with-their-own-ethereum-wallets">Brave-verified Publishers with Civic Reusable KYC will be able to collect earned BATs with their own Ethereum wallets</h3>
<p>Civic, the global digital identity leader, and Brave, an innovative privacy browser combined with a blockchain-based digital advertising platform, will collaborate to provide Civic’s identity verification services to Brave’s <a href="https://publishers.basicattentiontoken.org/">verified publishers</a>. Publishers will have the option to use Civic identity verification and other Know Your Customer (KYC) services in order to securely collect the Basic Attention Tokens (BATs) earned via the Brave browser and the BAT platform.</p>
<p>There are currently over 21,000 Brave-verified publishers, and 4 million monthly active users of the Brave browser. Brave users can opt to anonymously and automatically reward publisher content by donating BATs through the integrated Brave Payments system in the browser. In the future, publishers who provide their own Ethereum wallets to receive BAT payments will have the option to use Civic Reusable KYC to verify identity and ensure authenticity. Publishers will benefit from convenient, secure, and private identity verification through the Civic app.</p>
<p>Reusable digital identity is the core of Civic’s identity verification platform, and Civic Reusable KYC will enable publishers to safely and securely verify their identities and receive BAT contributions without sharing unnecessary data. Additionally, publishers will have a way to conveniently be identified with their mobile devices each time they log in to claim their tokens.</p>
<p>“Brave is a revolutionary browser that is combating some of the biggest Internet privacy challenges. As Brave is experiencing exponential publisher and user growth, implementing Civic will enable more people to safely and securely utilize the Brave platform while establishing and sustaining trust between publishers and users. We’re thrilled to partner with Brave and bring our trusted identity verification services to help build a better browser with the benefits of blockchain technology,” said Civic CEO and Co-Founder, Vinny Lingham.</p>
<p>“Brave and the Basic Attention Token aim to directly connect users and publishers in a transparent system to guarantee privacy and authenticity, without the intermediaries that harvest user data. Civic shares our values around privacy and protecting user information, and we’re excited to work with them to offer Civic Reusable KYC, which will be key to ensuring security and privacy on our publisher network,” said Brendan Eich, CEO and co-founder of Brave Software.</p>
<p>This collaboration was announced at Consumer Identity World in Seattle on Friday, September 21. Civic recently launched its Reusable KYC incentive campaign, called “Civic Libre”, where anyone with a legitimate business can benefit from no cost identity verification services until the end of 2018.</p>
<p>Civic and Brave were both recently named <a href="https://blogs.gartner.com/avivah-litan/2018/09/07/controlling-our-own-algorithms-cool-vendors-in-blockchain-technology/">“Cool Vendors in Blockchain Technology”</a> in a Gartner report profiling 4 enterprise architecture and technology innovation leaders.</p>

<h4 id="about-civic">About Civic</h4>

<h2 id="celebrating-bats-one-year-anniversary-key-milestones-and-a-glimpse-of-whats-to-come">Celebrating BAT’s One Year Anniversary: Key Milestones and a Glimpse of What’s to Come</h2>
<p>One year ago, the Basic Attention Token (BAT) sale started around 7.30am PT and sold out within 30 seconds, reaching the cap of 156,250 ETH and raising $36 million. As part of the sale, three hundred million tokens were set aside as a user growth pool (UGP) to incentivize users and publishers to join the platform. BAT is one of the few projects that raised a substantial amount via a token sale, has a product used by millions, and has consistently grown the utility of the token on its platform through partnerships and development. Today, as we look at BAT’s progress and growth, we’d like to recap the milestones we’ve reached in just one year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Last August, <a href="/bat-now-supported-on-the-uphold-platform/">Uphold</a> started supporting BAT, enabling Uphold members to hold, send, and convert BAT within their Uphold wallet.</li>
<li>By September, the BAT community had grown to over <a href="/update-growing-the-global-bat-community/">40 regional groups</a> on Facebook (over 50 today).</li>
<li>Within 4.5 months of the sale (October), the <a href="/bat-mercury-launch/">first phase</a> of BAT (Mercury) was completed with the integration of BAT into the Brave browser and Brave Payments, converting payments from bitcoin to BAT and allowing BAT contributions to publishers.</li>
<li>By November, the BAT platform was expanded to <a href="https://brave.com/brave-expands-basic-attention-token-platform-to-youtube/">YouTube</a>, enabling audiences to use Brave Payments to reward their favorite creators with BATs, and then further expanded to Twitch streamers in March.</li>
<li>In February, we simplified the BAT platform for our publishers and content creators, allowing a single account to manage <a href="https://brave.com/multi-property-support-now-live-for-brave-verified-creators/">multiple properties</a> (web site, YouTube account, or Twitch account) to collect BAT.</li>
<li>Via partnerships with <a href="https://brave.com/dow-jones/">Dow Jones Media Group</a> (April) and <a href="https://brave.com/townsquare-partnership/">Townsquare Media</a> (May), BAT blockchain-based technology is being tested in digital publishing and advertising. BAT is also partnering with YouTube stars <a href="https://brave.com/brave-update-partners-creators-users-and-growth-april-2018/">Bart Baker and Philip DeFranco</a> regarding new reward programs and community outreach.</li>
</ul>
<p>The BAT platform has also seen <strong>growth and utility</strong> in multiple areas this past year, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over 2.4 million monthly active users for the Brave browser.</li>
<li>Over 16,000 verified <a href="https://publishers.basicattentiontoken.org/">publishers</a>, including over 11,000 YouTube creators with over 180 million combined subscribers.</li>
<li>A vibrant community with thousands of participants on <a href="https://twitter.com/AttentionToken">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/brave_browser/">Reddit</a>.</li>
<li>Over 63,000 token <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x0d8775f648430679a709e98d2b0cb6250d2887ef">holders</a>.</li>
<li>$1 million equivalent in BAT <a href="https://brave.com/million-dollars-paid-out/">allocated</a> from the User Growth Pool to over 52,000 publishers and creators.</li>
<li>An ongoing $2 million <a href="https://brave.com/refer">referral program</a> for publishers and creators, with over 7,500 currently participating.</li>
</ul>
<p>Later this year, we will deliver <strong>new features</strong> and announce <strong>new partners</strong> for the BAT platform, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monthly payments to both publishers (via Brave Payments) and Brave users (via regular grants from the User Growth Pool), so users can support more creators and get rewarded for browsing with Brave.</li>
<li>BAT features for mobile platforms.</li>
<li>Opt-in, privacy-preserving ads that reward users with BAT.</li>
<li>A revamped Brave Payments designed for ease-of-use.</li>
<li>New features for the wallet in partnership with Uphold to make the contribution experience more seamless for users.</li>
<li>Partnerships with more publishers and creators.</li>
</ul>
<p>As we celebrate BAT’s first year, we’d like to thank all of our users, supporters, and creators for these achievements and for helping us scale a platform that is revolutionizing browsing and digital advertising. In the next year, we’re looking forward to reconnecting users, publishers, and advertisers to deploy a model that will preserve privacy, contribute to creator revenue, and reduce fraud, creating a better web for all.</p>

BAT Mercury integrates a BAT wallet into the Brave browser and converts contributions from Bitcoin to BAT in Brave Payments.</p>
<p>All of our software is open source. We welcome feedback from developers or testers regarding this beta build. Please make sure to <a href="https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop/wiki/Creating-a-Backup-of-your-Profile">backup</a> your profile before testing.</p>
<p>If you would like to report an issue, please visit our GitHub browser-laptop <a href="https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop/issues">page</a>. We’re grateful for your contributions and look forward to sharing Brave 0.19 with everyone soon!</p>
<p>Note:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please be advised that it could take up to one hour for the conversion from Bitcoin to BAT to complete when you upgrade your wallet.</li>
<li>It is very safe to create a new BAT wallet and add funds so long as you back up the new wallet.</li>
<li>It’s recommended that <strong>users with existing funds</strong> wait until the actual release to convert from <strong>BTC -&gt; BAT</strong>. However, if users would like to test converting from <strong>BTC -&gt; BAT</strong>, it is currently possible for amounts <strong>less than 0.07 BTC</strong>, though it is recommended to test converting in smaller amounts. Note that this only affects conversion of existing BTC wallets, not funding a new BAT wallet with BTC.</li>

The first BAT-enabled version of the Brave browser will be the <a href="https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop/milestone/72">0.19 release</a>. As such, we want to provide an overview of the backend and client library changes already completed and deployed in preparation for the imminent BAT Mercury launch.</p>
<p>We also want to address the time table for landing in 0.19 and the first phase of BAT Mercury. The backend and client libraries are on target. If we rushed to meet our previously announced deployment date, the product would not have met the high standards our users deserve. There are a number of open issues in the browser ledger code that we noted during BAT Mercury integration work. None of these are breaking, but together they fall short of our minimum viable product standards. More involved browser-side refactoring is needed for launch. We appreciate the patience of everyone involved as we want to offer the best to our users and community.</p>
<p>Given our rate of progress on the more comprehensive browser-side refactoring, we’re happy to announce that the first phase of BAT Mercury will be live by Friday, October 6th. You can follow our run up to the release of 0.19 <a href="https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop/milestone/72">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="bat-mercury-components">BAT Mercury Components</h3>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> All of our BAT software is developed as open source software on our <a href="https://github.com/brave-intl">github account</a>.</p>

<h4 id="the-bat-ledger-repository">The BAT-ledger repository</h4>
<p>The BAT ledger <a href="https://github.com/brave-intl/bat-ledger">repository</a> is the primary service of the platform. The client library in the browser talks to the repository. The <a href="https://github.com/brave-intl/bat-ledger/tree/master/ledger">“ledger”</a> server is responsible for several things:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Browser wallet creation</strong>: According to the Practicals <a href="https://github.com/brave-intl/bat-ledger/blob/master/documentation/Ledger-Practicals.md#how-wallets-are-created">document</a>, wallet creation is a two-step process. First, the client (browser) creates a keypair using the excellent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaCl_(software)">NaCl library</a>. The secret key is held by the client and not kept anywhere else. Next, the browser uses the secret key to sign a data packet for the wallet provider. The packet proves that the client “knows” the secret key in the keypair. The data packet is sent to the ledger server and then to the wallet provider — an important part of the architecture is that the ledger server acts as an untrusted intermediary between the client (browser) and the wallet provider. This allows the ledger server to verify BAT Mercury’s “business logic”, but does not allow the server to initiate transactions. Once verification is complete, the wallet provider generates a BAT wallet.</li>
<li><strong>Contribution submission</strong>: According to the Practicals <a href="https://github.com/brave-intl/bat-ledger/blob/master/documentation/Ledger-Practicals.md#how-contributions-are-submitted">document</a>, contribution submission is also a two-step process. First, the client (browser) indicates the amount of the contribution in BAT and the ledger server returns an unsigned transaction, which the client then signs with the secret key. This proves that it “knows” the secret key that was used to create the browser wallet. Again, the ledger server acts as an untrusted intermediary between the client (browser) and the wallet provider, ensuring that the client didn’t change any parameters in the data packet. Next, the wallet provider signals success and the ledger server gives the browser a number of anonymous, independent ballot envelopes, based on the size of the transaction.</li>
<li><strong>Configuration updates</strong>: The ledger acts as repository for information used by the client library to provide a better user experience. It contains the list of publicly-known verified publishers, and two sets of rules: one that converts a URL and optionally, a DOM tree, into a publisher-identifier; and a second, that indicates whether a publisher-identifier is eligible for “auto-inclusion.” (As the name implies, “auto-inclusion” allows the browser to decide whether a site should be considered eligible for inclusion in a user’s list of favorite sites. Some sites, such as e-commerce sites, aren’t eligible for auto-inclusion).</li>
</ul>
<p>Those following closely are aware that we use <a href="https://uphold.com/">Uphold.com</a> as a wallet provider. They enable the key feature of associating different deposit addresses with the browser wallet. Thus, each browser wallet has an Ethereum address as well as a Bitcoin address. These deposit addresses are available to the client (browser), so it’s very easy to transition the browser wallet from BTC to BAT: the browser contacts the ledger server for the Bitcoin proof-of-concept and signs a Bitcoin transaction to move the balance to a Bitcoin address that automatically converts the BTC to BAT and deposits it to the browser’s wallet.</p>

<h4 id="the-bat-ledger-repository-part-deux">The BAT-ledger repository (part deux)</h4>
<p>The BAT repository includes a second server, the <a href="https://github.com/brave-intl/bat-ledger/tree/master/eyeshade">“eyeshade”</a> server. This is the backend accounting server for BAT Mercury.</p>
<p>The most significant work required for the eyeshade server is to convert all of its units from satoshis to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum#Ether">wei</a>. The satoshi is the smallest unit of Bitcoin and the wei is the smallest integral unit of BAT. It takes 10^8 satoshis to make one BTC (100,000,000) but 10^18 wei to make one BAT. Because we want to avoid dealing with fractional numbers, everything in the server has to be denominated in the smallest integral unit. The problem is that numbers like 23089569056300000000 (a little over 23 BAT) can not be represented without a loss of precision. The solution is to use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary-precision_arithmetic">BigNum package</a> that does arbitrary-precision arithmetic.</p>
<p>In order to future-proof the eyeshade server, units are now represented as two fields: an altcurrency field, which is a string like “BAT” indicating what kind of currency or utility token is in use, and a probi field. The term probi is the plural of probus.  It is named after the Roman philologist and cryptographer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Valerius_Probus">Marcus Valerius Probus</a>. Unlike the term satoshi, which always refers to Bitcoin, and wei, which always refers to Ethereum and (existing) ERC-20 tokens, the term probi is meaningful only when paired with an altcurrency. Think of it like a vector: you need both a magnitude and a direction to make sense of it.</p>

<h4 id="the-bat-balance-repository">The BAT-balance repository</h4>
<p>BAT balance is a small helper <a href="https://github.com/brave-intl/bat-balance">library</a> used by the browser for getting the balance of a browser-held BAT wallet. It polls a BAT balance server to determine the current amount.</p>
<p>Having a separate server may seem counterintuitive to those more versed in cryptocurrencies. The simplest solution would seem to be polling for the Ethereum address balance on one of many public blockchain APIs, including our own. This would be analogous to the strategy used in the Bitcoin proof-of-concept. Here, however, this strategy is not available to us as browser-held BAT are not kept long term under the Ethereum address made available for deposits.</p>
<p>Instead, transfers made to any of the cryptocurrency deposit addresses are automatically transferred in their entirety by Uphold to their internal pool address. This enables the feature mentioned above whereby a user can transfer Bitcoin to the browser BAT wallet and it will be automatically converted into BAT. Furthermore, movements between Uphold wallets are not on-chain and thus incur no additional transaction costs. Contributions in BAT Mercury can flow from browser users to publishers entirely within the Uphold system without being double charged.</p>

<h4 id="the-bat-client-repository">The BAT-client repository</h4>
<p>The BAT client <a href="https://github.com/brave-intl/bat-client">repository</a> talks to the ledger server and is loaded by the Brave browser.  One of the more challenging aspects of implementing the library is supporting the <a href="https://gitlab.com/abhvious/anonize2">Anonize2</a> protocol in a browser. Some of the operations in that protocol are computationally-expensive (i.e., noticeably slow), and have to be done asynchronously. Implementing them in a platform-neutral way requires both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emscripten">emscripten</a> (because some cryptography and math libraries are just “wrong” on some platforms) and a threading system independent of the node.js library.</p>
<p>There is also a BAT publisher <a href="https://github.com/brave-intl/bat-publisher">repository</a> that is used by the client (browser) to maintain a browsing synopsis, such as domains visited and Basic Attention Metric measurements. In a future blog post, we’ll discuss this repository along with the publisher-identification rules to explain how we plan to support publishers and content producers who use YouTube and Twitch.tv.</p>

<h3 id="what-you-can-do-to-prepare">What You Can Do to Prepare</h3>
<p>If you are a current user of the Brave browser and the Bitcoin proof-of-concept system, then you don’t need to do anything other than upgrade to Brave 0.19 when prompted. A new Brave wallet will automatically be created for you. Additionally, if there’s a balance in your existing Brave wallet, then your browser will automagically transfer the balance to the equivalent amount of BAT in your new Brave wallet.</p>
<p>If you are a publisher, or planning to verify as a publisher with Brave, you can <a href="https://uphold.com/signup">sign up</a> at Uphold now and start the process of becoming a verified Uphold member. You’ll need to have a verified Uphold account in order to receive contributions, so there’s no harm in taking care of that “before the rush.”</p>
<p>Brave-verified publishers that have completed the tax-related and KYC-related (know your customer) paperwork for the Bitcoin proof-of-concept will be required to create an Uphold account and go through their verification process to start collecting BAT. However, Brave-verified publishers will not need to re-verify control of their websites.</p>
<p>When BAT Mercury launches, the BAT <a href="/">website</a> will have the terms and conditions posted for review.</p>
<p>Although the Bitcoin proof-of-concept is closing down soon after BAT Mercury launches, no sunset date is set. This will be done by disabling additional contributions in the Bitcoin proof-of-concept and distributing final contributions to existing publishers.</p>

<h3 id="finally">Finally</h3>
<p>It is important to remember that use of BAT is not limited to the Brave browser — any developer is allowed to integrate the browser of their choice with the BAT Mercury service (Of course, the developer will need to be able to modify their browser’s source code). In fact, the BAT client library doesn’t have to be used. All of the protocol interactions are defined in the Practicals <a href="https://github.com/brave-intl/bat-ledger/blob/master/documentation/Ledger-Practicals.md#how-contributions-are-submitted">document</a>. As the roadmap stated, we intend to form a trade group to govern rules and auditing requirements for clients, once BAT in Brave is solid.</p>

<p><strong>Uphold to support Brave’s Basic Attention Token,
the new utility token for blockchain-based digital advertising</strong></p>
<p>Uphold and Basic Attention Token (BAT) are excited to announce a new partnership to provide support for BAT, an Ethereum-based utility token, on the Uphold platform.</p>
<p>Once the integration of BAT is complete, Uphold members will be able to hold, send, and convert BAT within their Uphold wallet, in addition to the fiat and crypto currencies Uphold already <a href="https://support.uphold.com/hc/en-us/articles/202473803-Supported-currencies">supports</a>. If you are new to Uphold, please refer to the <a href="https://uphold.com/en/how-it-works/membership">how it works</a> section for more information.</p>
<p>The Uphold support for BAT will help Brave users fund their wallets via a variety of currencies to contribute to sites. It will also facilitate the contribution settlement process for publishers with automatic conversion of BAT and direct deposit of fiat currency into a publisher’s account.</p>
<p>Uphold is excited to welcome the BAT community to its platform. BAT radically improves the efficiency of digital advertising by creating a new utility token that can easily be utilized among publishers, advertisers, and users. It is a utility token based on the Ethereum blockchain that serves as the unit of account in the new BAT blockchain-based digital advertising and services platform.</p>
<p>Uphold’s partnership with the BAT team furthers Uphold’s mission to enable people all over the world to hold any form of money, commodity, or utility tokens securely, and to be able to transact seamlessly.</p>
<p>We look forward to sharing more exciting news about this partnership and the functionality of BAT within the Uphold ecosystem. We will continue to provide updates via our Twitter and Facebook pages.</p>

<h4 id="using-regional-fb-bat-pages-for-growing-our-global-community">Using Regional FB BAT Pages for Growing Our Global Community</h4>
<p>Facebook Pages are a natural starting point for growing our global community. They have a large user base and easy cross-profile sharing.</p>
<p>In this first phase, our community managers will make calls to action for regional volunteers to set up BAT Community Facebook Pages in their countries.</p>
<p>Our community managers will coordinate with these volunteers, providing a regional starter kit that includes graphics, information and other helpful resources to get their regional FB BAT community up and running.</p>

<h4 id="from-volunteers-to-regional-bat-community-leaders">From Volunteers to Regional BAT Community Leaders</h4>
<p>Volunteers will become regional leaders for their BAT communities. These leaders will collaborate and brainstorm with their peers within <a href="https://basicattentiontoken.rocket.chat/">https://basicattentiontoken.rocket.chat</a> on efforts to help spread awareness and education about BAT in their regions.</p>
<p>Regional leaders will coordinate with their teams to write blogs, translate BAT materials and resources, organize meetups and test groups for trial phases in the BAT roadmap.</p>

<h4 id="weve-already-started">We’ve Already Started!</h4>
<p>Over the past few weeks, we engaged with volunteers, and are pleased to announce our first set of regional BAT Facebook pages and leaders:</p>

The initial outline for Mercury was included in our <a href="/bat-roadmap-1-0/">roadmap</a> announcement and the design concept is available on <a href="https://github.com/brave-intl/bat-mercury-concept">Github</a>. BAT Mercury will be rolled out incrementally.</p>
<p>The Brave browser will be the first application on the BAT platform. The Brave browser currently allows users to make micro-contributions to publishers through the use of a Bitcoin wallet and ledger system. The launch of Mercury is targeted for mid-September and will include the replacement of the Bitcoin wallet integrated into the browser with a BAT wallet.</p>

<h4 id="browser-user-onboarding-with-in-browser-bat-wallet-creation">Browser User Onboarding (with in-browser BAT wallet creation)</h4>
<p>BAT Mercury will utilize a portion of the 300 million BAT retained in the <a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/faq/#UGP">user growth pool</a>. Users who enable BAT Mercury within the Brave browser will have their wallets automatically funded. At launch, the BAT wallet will be restricted from sending to addresses other than our settlement address; users will not be able to transfer BAT out of their in-browser wallet. The BAT flow in the browser will allow publishers to begin experimenting with reward models to spur patronage of their sites and services. A subsequent update will allow users to fund their BAT wallet similarly to how they are able to fund their Bitcoin wallet.</p>
<p>Another future update will give users the option of going through a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer">“Know Your Customer” (KYC)</a> process in order to gain full control over their BAT wallet, including the ability to transfer BAT out of the wallet.</p>

<p>The BAT Mercury interface will appear familiar to users who have enabled the current Bitcoin-based Brave Payments beta. BAT Mercury features the granular fine-tuning contribution options and advanced settings from the current Bitcoin (but to be replaced with BAT) Brave Payments beta, including monthly publisher contributions that are either pro-rata or “pinned,” i.e., a pre-set amount.</p>
<p>There are two notable differences in the BAT Mercury interface:</p>
<ul>
<li>The monthly budget and account balance are now denominated in BAT.</li>
<li>The purchase BAT button will remain inactive for the initial launch, as the BAT awarded from the user growth pool will initiate the one-way contribution flow at no cost to the user. However, with the multi-directional wallet update planned in later phases, the purchase BAT button will be reactivated</li>

<p>BAT Mercury contribution algorithms will be retained from the Brave Payments beta. Measured attention from the active browser tab is distributed across the list of visited domains. Pinned contributions will be supported too, as in Brave Payments beta today.</p>
<p>Every 30 days the browser will attempt to send user contributions to the publishers.<a href="https://github.com/brave/ledger/blob/master/documentation/Ledger-Principles.md"> Anonymous BAT contributions</a> will be automatically transferred from the user’s wallet to a contribution settlement account using <a href="https://gitlab.com/abhvious/anonize2">Anonize2</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof">Zero-Knowledge Proof</a> protocols.</p>
<p>Aside from the denomination units being BAT, the contribution summary and statements for BAT Mercury are the same as in the Brave Payments beta.</p>

<h4 id="publisher-onboarding-and-verification">Publisher Onboarding and Verification</h4>
<p>The BAT Platform publisher onboarding and verification process will remain largely unchanged from the existing Brave solution. An interested publisher will perform two levels of <a href="https://publishers.brave.com/">verification</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>The publisher enters contact information, including an email address. They will then receive an email containing a validation URL. Since the URL contains a random secret, a visit by the publisher demonstrates that they can receive email at the address they provided.</li>
<li>After visiting the validation URL, the publisher will be redirected to prove domain ownership. A publisher can either perform DNS validation by setting a TXT record or uploading a file to a specific address on their web site.</li>
</ol>
<p>After verification, publishers will go through a slightly modified process to finish onboarding for BAT Mercury.</p>
<p>In the Brave Payments beta, the publisher entered a Bitcoin address to receive contributions, and completed a form indicating their US tax-filing status. This latter information was used for reporting compliance (Brave is required to file a 1099-MISC for US individuals and limited-liability corporations), and served as the “Know Your Customer” process for the publisher.</p>
<p>In BAT Mercury, instead of asking for a Bitcoin (or ETH) address the publisher is redirected to a third-party financial services platform:</p>

<p>The platform supports BAT, fiat currencies (such as USD, EUR, GBP, etc.), and other crypto currencies. The platform also provides <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Clearing_House">US ACH</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_transfer">wire transfer</a> services for fiat currencies. We have already reached agreement with the platform that will provide these services and will soon announce the details of this partnership.</p>
<p>BAT Mercury will offer automatic conversion of BAT and direct deposit of fiat currency into a publisher’s account. This allows us to offer a contribution settlement process that is more familiar to publishers, increasing the likelihood of adoption. As part of publisher onboarding by the platform, they will authorize the disclosure of the ETH address of the account and set their preferred fiat currency.</p>
<p>The BAT team will provide additional information as it becomes available. For the latest information, please track our #announcements channel in <a href="https://basicattentiontoken.rocket.chat/">basicattentiontoken.rocket.chat</a>.</p>

<p>The sale also provided our development team with resources to continue building the BAT platform. We started this work last fall, with the Brave Payments beta which uses Bitcoin for automated micro-donations to publishers. We’re pleased with the success of Brave Payments, which currently has 162 verified publishers.</p>
<p>We will recruit around twenty people over several months, in small groups that match the ongoing priorities of our roadmap. We are looking for talent in machine learning, Ethereum, devops, project management, marketing, design, as well as more browser developers.</p>
<p>As was outlined recently in the BAT roadmap, we’re in the <a href="/bat-roadmap-1-0/">Mercury</a> phase of our platform development. We are using sale funds to hire several people to complete this phase, including BAT wallet integration into Brave and converting Brave Payments from Bitcoin to BAT. It also includes developing the on-device machine learning models that privately match catalogued ads as well as developing the framework of user-private ad experience.</p>
<p>We’ve <a href="https://brave.com/about-jobs.html">posted the following openings on our site</a>. We look forward to receiving your resumes or portfolios, depending on the job description.</p>

The transition begins Wednesday, 07.12.2017 at 11AM PDT.</p>

<h3 id="why-are-we-leaving-slack">Why are we leaving Slack?</h3>
<p>The best current practice for blockchain project teams has been to use Slack for open communication. Until recently, this worked well. However, bad actors began taking advantage of this openness, attempting to scam participants.</p>
<p>BAT was not the only project to have its Slack channel impacted by these bad actors. Several blockchain projects were attacked simultaneously, in some cases by users with the same screen names. The BAT Slack monitors witnessed an increase in incidents and reports from our community concerning false information and fraudulent messages.</p>
<ul>
<li>Direct messages were used in some cases by users pretending to be BAT staff.</li>
<li>The <strong>/remind</strong> Slackbot command was used on occasion to send false information.</li>
<li>The Incoming Webhooks integration was used once to pose as the BAT APP and send messages about a fake “second sale.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Experience shows that Slack was not designed for large communities that need to manage bad actors. So we reviewed and tested other platforms that promote transparent discussion while providing moderators and administrator additional control to remove bad actors.</p>
<p>After reviewing several options, we chose <a href="https://rocket.chat/"><strong>rocket.chat</strong></a>.</p>

<h3 id="the-transition-process">The transition process</h3>
<ul>
<li>Beginning Wednesday, 07.12.2017 at 11AM PDT, the BAT team will transition daily discussion to <a href="https://basicattentiontoken.rocket.chat/">https://basicattentiontoken.rocket.chat/</a></li>
<li>Current BAT Slack users will not be migrated into rocket.chat.</li>
<li>The BAT Slack will remain open for 7 days during the transition to rocket.chat.</li>
<li>Channels in the BAT Slack will be updated to become read-only during this 7 day transition, and will include announcements about the transition.</li>
<li>Our community managers will help facilitate the transition. We are also continuing to expand our team of community managers, with the goal of having full coverage across time zones on a 24/7 basis.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="friendly-reminders">Friendly reminders</h3>
<ul>
<li>The official source of accurate information regarding all things BAT remains the official website: <a href="/">https://basicattentiontoken.org</a></li>
<li>BAT staff will not directly message users with important updates. Do not click links with “calls to action” that are sent in direct messages.</li>
<li>When in doubt, ask questions in open channels, and please report suspicious users or activities to BAT administrators.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="in-conclusion-we-still-love-slack">In conclusion, we still love Slack!</h3>
<p>We want to emphasize that these issues do not reflect on Slack for its intended use cases. Slack is an awesome tool. As commonly used by enterprises, Slack teams do not have to worry about random users sending fraudulent messages from the slackbot. Internally, our team uses and enjoys Slack as a part of our regular workflow.</p>
<p>Also, we would like to add a huge thank you to everyone in our Slack community, and those from other project teams that reported bad actors and other incidents that occurred over the past two weeks. We look forward to continuing the open discussion and engagement with the community as we build the BAT platform.</p>

Basic Attention Token.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 id="basics">Basics</h2>

<h3 id="what-does-bat-stand-for-and-what-is-it">What does BAT stand for and what is it?</h3>
<p>Basic Attention Token. It is a utility token based on the Ethereum technology that can also be used as a unit of account between advertisers, publishers, and users in a new, blockchain-based digital advertising and services platform. The token is not a digital currency, security or a commodity. To learn more about how the BAT platform is working with the Brave browser, please see below.</p>

<h3 id="are-bats-transferable-where-are-bats-traded">Are BATs transferable? Where are BATs traded?</h3>
<p>BAT is a utility token meant for use in the BAT platform. It is transferable. While we are aware that the token is currently being traded on the exchanges listed <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/assets/basic-attention-token/#markets">here</a>, we have not encouraged or facilitated this exchange trading in any way. We have provided the foregoing information solely as a means of reducing the inquiries we receive directly.</p>

<h3 id="what-do-bats-represent">What do BATs represent?</h3>
<p>The utility tokens are intended for use on the BAT platform, a new Blockchain-based digital advertising and services platform. Ownership of the tokens carry no rights other than the right to use them as a means to obtain services on the BAT platform, and to enable usage of and interaction with the platform, if successfully completed and deployed. The tokens do not represent or confer any ownership right or stake, share or security or equivalent rights, or any right to receive future revenue shares, intellectual property rights or any other form of participation in or relating to the BAT platform, and/or Brave and its affiliates.  The tokens are not refundable and are not intended to be a digital currency, security, commodity or any other kind of financial instrument.</p>
<p>Additional information regarding the utility of BAT is available in the <a href="/terms-and-conditions/">terms and conditions</a>.</p>

<h3 id="where-will-bat-be-used">Where will BAT be used?</h3>
<p>We are building the BAT platform to integrate the Brave browser (see below), Brave’s ledger system, as well as a BAT wallet and related blockchain-attested functionality. The utility token is for conducting transactions and obtaining services on the platform. The token will be used, for example, in acquiring ad slots to be filled with privately matched, anonymously confirmed ads.</p>
<p>Given the open-source nature of the project, however, we also envision that as we develop the BAT protocol, third-party developers may come up with new and novel uses for the token.</p>
<p><strong>Some of these could include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Other browsers: One obvious use case for the token is for it to be used inside other browsers. This means that the BAT ecosystem will extend out to anyone using any of the current popular browsers.</li>
<li>Telegram bot: In messaging apps like Telegram, we foresee the possibility of users being paid in BAT to view one ad.</li>
<li>WeChat official account: WeChat has become a robust system of bots, payments, and other solutions. We foresee the creation of different WeChat solutions integrating the the token.</li>
<li>Token and Status: The BAT also has attention-based applicability inside the Ethereum-based messaging/payment platforms such as Coinbase’s new Token app and Status app.</li>
<li>These apps must be fraud-resistant if they are to participate.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-do-i-view-bat-tokens-in-my-wallet">How do I view BAT tokens in my wallet?</h3>
<p>You can view BAT token balance in your non-hosted Ethereum wallet that supports ERC20 tokens by watching the BAT contract.</p>
<ul>
<li>BAT Smart Contract address: <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x0D8775F648430679A709E98d2b0Cb6250d2887EF">0x0D8775F648430679A709E98d2b0Cb6250d2887EF</a></li>
<li>Number of Digits: 18</li>
<li>Symbol: BAT</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="which-wallets-can-be-used-to-store-bat">Which wallets can be used to store BAT?</h3>
<p>BAT is an ERC20 token, and can be stored in ERC20 compatible wallets. We do not recommend a particular product, but some users report storing their BAT using a <a href="https://shop.ledger.com/?r=0ba5d7199327">Ledger Nano S</a> hardware wallet and <a href="https://www.myetherwallet.com/">MyEtherWallet</a>.</p>

<p>Ethereum (ETH).</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-distribution-of-tokens">What is the distribution of tokens?</h3>
<p>One billion BAT was sold. In addition to the tokens sold, we created a development team pool of 200 million tokens. Finally, we created a user growth pool (UGP) of 300 million BAT. To learn more about the UGP, please see the following chart and more information below:</p>

<h3 id="what-was-the-value-of-bat-sold--will-there-be-a-follow-on-sale">What was the value of BAT sold?  Will there be a follow-on sale?</h3>
<p>We sold the equivalent of 156,250 ETH, or 1 billion tokens. We do not plan to have a follow-on BAT sale.</p>

<h3 id="what-was-the-sale-price-at-the-time-of-token-sale">What was the sale price at the time of token sale?</h3>
<p>The ICO price on the sale date of May 31, 2017 was 1 ETH to 6,400 BAT.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-bat-smart-contract-address">What is the BAT smart contract address?</h3>
<p>We are providing the BAT smart contract address as a matter of information:  <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x0D8775F648430679A709E98d2b0Cb6250d2887EF">0x0D8775F648430679A709E98d2b0Cb6250d2887EF</a>. However, the token sale is over so DO NOT send any ETH here or it will be sent back. Also, DO NOT send any BAT or other types of tokens here, it will be lost.</p>

<h3 id="how-will-the-user-growth-pool-be-used">How will the user growth pool be used?</h3>
<p>An integral part of the token sale is the creation of a user growth pool of 300 million tokens. These tokens will be used to incentivize users to join the BAT platform. We anticipate that when users download the Brave browser they will be rewarded with tokens. The final number is not yet determined. Potentially, this could prompt tens of millions of users to join.</p>
<p>Once in the system, users will be able to obtain services and gain and spend BAT in a number of different scenarios. Users will be able to use tokens in exchange for premium content from publishers. Users will also be able to donate tokens to publishers. The Brave browser already has a donation system in beta. Publishers could also incentivize users to download their app with BAT. We are confident there are many other services and use cases that will surface as the ecosystem comes to life.</p>

<h3 id="when-the-token-sale-was-completed-where-were-the-funds-eth-stored">When the token sale was completed, where were the funds (ETH) stored?</h3>
<p>We use the standard Ethereum multi-signature wallet to store the ETH paid for the BAT.</p>
<p> </p>

<h2 id="bat-and-brave">BAT and Brave</h2>

<h3 id="explain-the-brave-and-bat-products-and-how-they-work-together">Explain the Brave and BAT products and how they work together.</h3>
<p>BAT is a utility token for a new, blockchain-based digital advertising and services platform. Brave is a privacy-focused, secure web browser that blocks ads by default and provides surfing speeds up 7x faster than its competitors. Brave currently runs an experimental automated and anonymous micro-donation system for publishers called Brave Payments. The BAT platform will absorb the Brave Payments ledger, which will migrate from Bitcoin micropayments to BAT microdonations in the near future. The platform will further extend this work into advertising. Users have the choice of whether or not to opt-in to see ads, which use a separate open source component. When users opt-in to receive ads in the platform, ads will be privately matched to their interests and anonymously confirmed. Publishers are rewarded accordingly with tokens. The user remains anonymous to all parties. Users who opt-in will also get a share of BATs and can use them on premium products, donate them back to publishers, etc.</p>

<h3 id="how-can-a-publisher-apply-to-become-part-of-bat-platform-that-is-being-integrated-into-the-brave-browser">How can a publisher apply to become part of BAT platform that is being integrated into the Brave browser?</h3>
<p>If you are a publisher or content provider interested in joining the BAT platform on Brave, the best way to get going is join the current Brave publisher program <a href="https://publishers.brave.com/">here</a>. Then we will transition you onto the Brave BAT platform once it is launched.</p>

<h3 id="when-will-ads-in-the-bat-platform-be-available-to-opt-into-in-the-brave-browser">When will ads in the BAT platform be available to opt-into in the Brave browser?</h3>
<p>Early ad trials are projected to begin this fall. See our <a href="/bat-roadmap-1-0/">road map</a> for more details regarding ad development and scheduling.</p>

<h3 id="when-will-brave-payments-be-migrated-from-btc-to-bat">When will Brave Payments be migrated from BTC to BAT?</h3>
<p>BAT wallet integration, and migration from BTC to BAT in the Brave browser is projected for the Mercury Phase (Summer 2017) in our road map. See our <a href="/bat-roadmap-1-0/">road map</a> for more information.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-some-names-of-publishers-that-have-signed-up-for-brave-and-will-be-transitioned-to-the-bat-once-the-platform-is-finished">What are some names of publishers that have signed up for Brave and will be transitioned to the BAT once the platform is finished?</h3>
<p>Over 150 publishers have joined Brave Payments. <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/">Wikihow</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/">Archive.org</a>, and <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/">Smashing Magazine</a> have given us approval to use their names. Other large name publishers will be added.</p>

<h3 id="how-many-users-does-the-brave-browser-have">How many users does the Brave browser have?</h3>
<p>Brave app installations are available from the Apple iOS and Google Play Stores. We do not make public the number of users on Windows, OSX and Linux.</p>
<p> </p>

<h2 id="other">Other</h2>

<h3 id="how-does-bat-deal-with-ad-fraud">How does BAT deal with ad fraud?</h3>
<p>We’ve covered the problems with ad fraud in the existing ad model in <a href="/reducing-digital-ad-fraud/">this post</a>, but here are just a few ways that BAT deals with ad fraud: the token eliminates third-party traffic sourcing, and the Basic Attention Metrics (BAM) system reduces fraud entry points. The code will be auditable as open source, with attention and engagement verified using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof">Zero-Knowledge Proof</a> (ZKP) protocols. Ads and payouts will be rate limited, and user growth pool token awards distributed over time to make bot operations less desirable.</p>

<h4 id="foreword">Foreword</h4>
<p>I cofounded Mozilla and wrote its technology roadmaps back when we were rebooting the Netscape-contributed browser code via open source. Here’s the <a href="https://www-archive.mozilla.org/roadmap/roadmap-26-Oct-1998.html">first one</a>. <a href="https://www-archive.mozilla.org/roadmap/roadmap-02-Apr-2003.html">This one</a> from 2003, by David Hyatt and me, charted the direct course to Firefox.</p>
<p>These documents set direction and listed goals and requirements. Equally important, they renounced non-goals and listed what was off the agenda. For the BAT platform, any tracking or targeting from remote ad servers or exchanges is excluded by construction.</p>
<p>The map is not the terrain, so each roadmap ages past a point of usefulness and becomes a relic. I expect the same to happen with the BAT project’s roadmaps. This roadmap is likely to cover the next year to 18 months.</p>

<h4 id="approach">Approach</h4>
<p>The BAT sale provides the development team with enough resources to complete the platform work we started last fall using bitcoin in the “Brave Payments [beta]” experimental automated micro-donation system already in Brave. We intend to use the funds as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Recruit and retain Ethereum, machine learning, devops, project management, ad sales, UX design, and more browser development people, to build out the BAT platform in the stages outlined below.</li>
<li>As the BAT platform develops and gets integrated with Brave, evangelize other attention-economy apps, from browsers to games and beyond, to join an organization we will endow to promote user-first, private, and anonymous ads, donations, micro-paywall-piercing “link gifting”, and other token-based premium products, and share the BAT among apps other than Brave. We aim to make this a non-profit.</li>
<li>Create a source of seed funding, with exact structure to be determined, to sponsor entrepreneurs to create new BAT apps. This may take the form of an independently judged prize system in which apps must follow the endpoint software rules and on-chain smart contracts prototyped by the development team (1) and codified by the member organization (2).</li>
<li>Fund greater user growth of Brave and other BAT apps by rewarding users who choose to opt into the BAT platform, to get to greater scale sooner with the brands and agencies buying user-private ad slots, and (where publishers partner with us) ad slots on pages. Growth requires promotion and distribution above organic rate and scale, so we will fund it with some of the sale proceeds.</li>
</ol>
<p>The BAT platform work must be staged to fit modern “agile”/non-waterfall software development methods. In particular, it must fit Brave’s six-week <a href="https://chromium.org/">chromium</a> update cycle and the finer-grained milestone release structure that we use to manage scope creep and increase predictability.</p>
<p>The program of work outlined in this roadmap uses code-names borrowed from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_program">U.S. Space Program</a>. Reforming the attention economy of ad-tech and payments may not be rocket science, but it is still ambitious. We need to manage scope creep at a larger scale than the Brave development cadence.</p>
<p> </p>

<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>Some of this work will happen ahead of the rough dates in parentheses above, enabling other work to happen sooner. Other work that’s hard to estimate right now may take longer. We will adjust the roadmap quarterly and build a new one when this one has fulfilled its purpose.</p>
<p>Much depends on our hiring quickly and well. With the right talent engaged and working well together, I am confident we can build and scale this system to have complete user control and much better economics than the failing ad-tech ecosystem upon which the Web relies today. Let’s build it together. We are all-open-source, and we are hiring.</p>

They face growing ad blocking adoption, increasing fraud rates, and diminishing returns as Facebook and Google <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/04/26/google-facebook-digital-ads/">reportedly take 99% of all new digital ad revenue</a>.</p>
<p>This is driving some companies to offer alternative sources of revenue to publishers. <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-40132519">Google is rebooting Contributor, a micro-donation service that was discontinued in January 2016</a>. Patreon doubled since last year to 1 million patrons and 50,000 creators. In 2016, Brave introduced anonymous Bitcoin micropayments to publishers. Brave is now planning to integrate the Basic Attention Token (BAT) as the foundation of a new, blockchain-based digital advertising platform.</p>
<p>The range of alternative contribution methods make this an exciting time in the evolution toward a better web.</p>

<h3 id="google-contributor">Google Contributor</h3>
<p>The news of the Google Contributor re-release follows <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/04/report-google-will-add-an-ad-blocker-to-all-versions-of-chrome-web-browser/">months of speculation</a> about a potential ad filtering feature in Chrome. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/06/google-prepares-publishers-for-the-release-of-chrome-ad-blocking/">Google now confirms</a> the latter will be available in January 2018.</p>
<p>Google’s <a href="https://contributor.google.com/u/1/v/marketing">Contributor</a> allows users to purchase a monthly pass that replaces ads with microdonations for participating publishers. Ad replacement is a key feature, and as such, exploring Contributor may offer a preview of Google’s vision for replacing ad revenue.</p>
<p>News of both of these Google releases was too exciting to pass up, so we gave Google Contributor a test drive.</p>

<h4 id="google-contributor-test-drive">Google Contributor Test Drive</h4>

<h5 id="registration-and-setup">Registration and setup</h5>
<ul>
<li>Users begin the process here: <a href="https://contributor.google.com/v/marketing">https://contributor.google.com/v/marketing</a></li>
<li>The Contributor pass begins with a $5.00 payment.</li>
<li>Users select sites from <a href="https://support.google.com/contributor/answer/7324995">participating publishers</a> to replace ads with micropayments.</li>
<li>Micropayments are deducted from the $5.00 payment for each page view.</li>
<li>Rates per page vary from publisher-to-publisher. For example, Business Insider UK charges $0.04 for each page view, while other publishers charge $0.01. The majority of publishers tested charge $0.01 per page view.</li>
<li>Contributor only works when the user is signed into the Google account used for registration.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="experience">Experience</h5>
<p>We ran through several Contributor publishers: Business Insider UK, Popular Mechanics, Twitchy and WWG.</p>
<p>We observed mixed results, with ads displaying on Business Insider UK and Twitchy, but not on Popular Mechanics and WWG.</p>
<p>On Business Insider UK, the large horizontal and small rectangular above-the-fold display ads no longer showed up with Contributor enabled. However, we did observe Taboola ads mid-fold, and Sailthru ads below-the-fold.</p>

<p>This was surprising because the Contributor service advertises that the micropayments replace the ads.</p>

<h3 id="the-brave-approach">The Brave Approach</h3>

<h4 id="brave-payments">Brave Payments</h4>
<p>The Brave Payments ledger allows users to support publishers with anonymous contributions as they browse. It was introduced in 2016 and is currently available in the desktop browser as an option.  User privacy and anonymity are a priority. Ads and trackers are blocked by default, thereby cutting off malvertising threats flowing through ad exchanges.</p>
<ul>
<li>Brave Payments uses a technology called <a href="https://anonize.org/">Anonize</a>, which utilizes a special branch of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof">Zero Knowledge Proof</a>” cryptography for anonymous-but-accountable transactions.</li>
<li>Users can apply additional customization to their contributions as they choose, “or can simply let Brave browser code (only on your device, no server tracking) handle the distributions.</li>
<li>Users can pin sites to include them in Brave Payments as they browse, setting specific amounts for each.</li>
<li>Any publisher can receive contributions, they simply need to complete a verification process to receive the anonymous contributions.</li>
<li>Thanks to encryption in the browser, Brave’s servers never see user data in the clear. Anonize protects against donation lists becoming fingerprints.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="bat-platform">BAT Platform</h4>
<p>The Basic Attention Token (BAT) provides a natural fit for supporting publishers, as the purpose of the token is to attribute value to attention. The BAT Platform will absorb the Brave Payments ledger, which will migrate from Bitcoin micropayments to BAT microdonations in the near future. The BAT Platform will also introduce new features and settings, paving the way for an exciting and broad range of potential applications. The BAT also incentivizes users to join the platform by granting BATs from the user growth pool, and <a href="/">rewarding BATs for their attention</a>. The BAT will let users support sites via anonymous token-donation automation. Initially, the BAT Platform will be integrated within the Brave browser. Long-term, we intend for BAT to be utilized in other apps and browser extensions.</p>

<h4 id="the-differences-matter">The Differences Matter</h4>
<ul>
<li>Google Contributor and Brave Payments provide two very different approaches to publisher contributions.</li>
<li>Google Contributor removes some ads — but not all — while allowing for Google’s DoubleClick and other 3rd party ad and tracking requests to collect user data.</li>
<li>Brave blocks ads and 3rd party tracking requests by default, preventing those parties from collecting user data from those requests. Brave Payments and the imminent BAT Platform allow users to anonymously contribute to publishers that they choose to support. Users do not log into Brave servers, and Brave cannot see or collect user data thanks to cryptographic protocols.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both options are new, and are alternatives to the current free-for-all of digital advertising. The choice for users is stark: one option, Google Contributor, continues data tracking at the expense of user privacy, data plan, and battery life. The other option, Brave, gives users control of their data and privacy without compromises. The introduction of the BAT will also reward users for their attention with a revenue share per ad impression or action.</p>

<p>We look forward to developing the BAT to its fullest extent to enable a new blockchain-based digital advertising platform. Publishers, advertisers, and users all stand to benefit from a user-centric platform that supports web content. Some of this functionality is already prototyped in the Brave browser, using bitcoin and allowing users to opt-in to automated micro-donations to websites and account owners.</p>
<p>We are especially excited about the 300 million BATs available in the user growth pool. This resource will be used to incentivize users to join the platform, benefiting publishers and helping to ensure the success of the project.</p>
<p>We thank all interested parties. We appreciate your confidence in the BAT and we will provide additional updates in the coming days.</p>

We appreciate the questions we received and thought some background would help explain our approach. We strive for transparency and hope to clear up misunderstandings.</p>
<p>As everyone knows, USD/ETH prices have grown more volatile. When we first contemplated this project, the USD/ETH prices were relatively stable. For quite sometime, they hovered at around $10/ETH. We assumed people would be pleased with the simplicity of a fixed exchange rate. As ETH grew more volatile, we knew this would become challenging.  However, we didn’t receive any strong feedback on the fixed exchange rate in our published contracts.</p>
<p>As such, we maintained the same approach as the sale date neared. We gauged the volatility as we attempted to find a price that remained in line with the goals we had outlined. In the days before the exchange rate decision was made, the average trade price looked close to $153.</p>
<p>The exchange rate decision was made May 28 in the late evening. We considered the last 3 days of prices to try to reach the target price on the token sale day (approximately 2.5 day</p>
<p>Various members of the team looked at prices over the decision period, and I looked at the poloniex charts, which are fortunately still available here: <a href="https://poloniex.com/public?command=returnChartData&amp;currencyPair=USDT_ETH&amp;start=1495756800&amp;end=1496001600&amp;period=14400">https://poloniex.com/</a></p>
<p>Tether isn’t the best USD proxy, so we’ll scale it up by the 2% premium it trades at.</p>
<p>This is the chart we were looking at:</p>


    



<img
    class="mx-auto mb-5"
    src="/static-assets/images/optimized/pricing-the-bat-1.png"
    alt=""
/>
<p>If you look at the volume weighted field in that time range, it certainly looked pretty close to $153.6. The actual mean value (scaled up by the 2% tether premium) was $159.2.</p>


    



<img
    class="mx-auto mb-5"
    src="/static-assets/images/optimized/pricing-the-bat-2.png"
    alt=""
/>
<p>This was our best guess at the moment we made the pricing decision on pricing.</p>
<p>We would have liked to get this exactly right, but I suppose if we could predict crypto-currency prices at 3 days out, we’d be in a different line of business.</p>
<p>It is also important to remember that we may not be able to access our token sale proceeds until approximately June 29. The mean value of ETH is $109 during the 30 days prior to our decision. One could argue that the price may be going up for various reasons, but these are post-facto arguments.</p>
<p>The best interests of the company and the token holders remain aligned. A strong base allows the BAT to establish itself across the web as a new standard in a transparent and efficient blockchain-based digital advertising platform. The opportunity for all involved, e.g., users, publishers, advertisers, etc., is substantial.</p>
<p>In the end, we made some hard decisions. Do we wait for the volatility to reduce? Is there a more optimal exchange mechanism beyond a rate fixed at deploy time? There is good debate to be had on these issues. But, ultimately, people have to make their own decisions as to where to allocate their ETH and whether to purchase BAT. In the end, the market decides.</p>

<li>Any arbitration will occur in San Francisco County, California. Arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (&quot;<strong>JAMS</strong>&quot;), which are hereby incorporated by reference.

</ul>

<h2 id="15-governing-law-and-venue">15. Governing Law and Venue</h2>

<h2 id="exhibit-a-description-of-company-platform-and-bat">Exhibit A Description of Company, Platform, and BAT</h2>

<h3 id="1-overview-of-company-and-affiliates">1. Overview of Company and Affiliates</h3>
<p>The Company is an exempted company with limited liability incorporated in the Cayman Islands and is not subject to supervision or regulation by the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority. Company will have primary responsibility for the provision of Services and for administering the development of certain aspects of the Platform. Until recently, the Platform, including the Brave Browser and Brave Ledger System (each as defined below), was developed and operated entirely by the Company's affiliate, Brave Software, Inc. (&quot;<strong>Brave U.S.</strong>&quot;).  As part of a strategic reorganization, the Company and its corporate affiliates decided to provide the Services, and to administer development of related Platform components, from Company rather than Brave U.S.  Brave U.S. will continue to have primary responsibility for developing components of the Platform unrelated to the Services.  It is anticipated that Brave U.S. and other corporate affiliates will provide certain administrative, technical and development services to Company in connection with the Services and Platform.</p>

<h3 id="2-overview-of-current-platform">2. Overview of Current Platform</h3>
<p>Currently, the Platform consists of a browser (the &quot;<strong>Brave Browser</strong>&quot;) and attention scoring algorithms. The Brave Browser, which launched in 2016, is a fast, open source, privacy-focused browser that, by default, blocks ads and ad tracking technologies. It contains an open-source, zero knowledge proof ledger system (the &quot;<strong>Brave Ledger System</strong>&quot;). The ANONIZE algorithm is used to protect user privacy. User data is kept on the device and encrypted, shielding the identities of users. At present, Brave users make anonymous donations to publishers using Bitcoin. The Brave Ledger System automatically donates an amount of Bitcoin to publishers proportional to the attention given to a website.</p>

<h3 id="3-development-of-platform-with-bat-functionality-and-services">3. Development of Platform with BAT Functionality and Services</h3>
<p>The Company now intends to introduce new components into the Platform in the form of BAT and an accompanying BAT wallet (together, &quot;<strong>BAT Functionality</strong>&quot;).  BAT is based on the Ethereum protocol and conforms to the ERC20 standard. As a result of introducing BAT Functionality into the Platform, the Platform will integrate and consist of BAT Functionality, the Brave Browser, and the Brave Ledger System.  BAT will be the utility token for conducting transactions and obtaining Services on the Platform. Currently, it is anticipated that the primary services (&quot;<strong>Services</strong>&quot;) to be facilitated through BAT and the Platform, as developed and made available by Company, will relate to targeted advertising, promotions and other attention-based commercial uses.  However, BAT may also be used by publishers and advertisers for unlocking premium content.  Additionally, users will have the ability to donate BAT to individual content providers and publishers, among other charitable purposes. Further details regarding the Platform are described in the Basic Attention Token Whitepaper (&quot;<strong>Whitepaper</strong>&quot;), which is available at: <a href="/">https://basicattentiontoken.org</a>. The information contained in the Whitepaper and Brave's website are of descriptive nature only, and do not, unless explicitly incorporated herein, form part of the Terms. Although Company intends to develop the Platform in the manner generally described above, it reserves the right to modify features, functionalities or development plans in its sole and absolute discretion.</p>

<h2 id="exhibit-b-token-sale-procedures-and-specifications">Exhibit B Token Sale Procedures and Specifications</h2>

<h3 id="1-total-number-of-bat-to-be-created-and-sold">1. Total Number of BAT to be Created and Sold</h3>
<p>Company will create up to 1.5 billion BAT through the Smart Contract System. Before the Sale Period Begins, the Smart Contract System will create and directly release a pool of 500 million pre-allocated BAT to the Company (&quot;<strong>Company BAT</strong>&quot;) for certain uses as described in Section 5 of this <strong>Exhibit B</strong>.  A separate pool of up to 1 billion BAT will be created by the Smart Contract System for sale by the Company to purchasers during the Sale Period. All BAT will be of equal value and functionality.</p>

<h3 id="2-commencement-and-duration-of-token-sale">2. Commencement and Duration of Token Sale</h3>
<p>The Company's sale of BAT will (a) begin at the time that mining commences on Ethereum block 3,798,640 and (b) continue until the time that (i) 156,250 Ether has been received by Company or (ii) mining commences on Ethereum block 3,963,480, whichever is earlier (the &quot;<strong>Sale Period</strong>&quot;). Based on current Ethereum block mining times, the Company estimates that Ethereum block 3,798,640 will be mined on or about 8:00 am PDT on May 31, 2017, and that Ethereum block 3,963,480 will be mined on or about 30 days thereafter.  For the avoidance of doubt, these estimates are provided for informational purposes only, and the Sale Period will commence and conclude strictly according to its definition above. If less than 27,343.8 Ether have been received by Company during the Sale Period (the &quot;<strong>Activation Threshold</strong>&quot;), each purchaser will have the possibility to initiate the transfer of the respective amount of Ether submitted to the Smart Contract System from the Smart Contract System's address back to the address used by that purchaser to transfer Ether to the Smart Contract System. If, during the Sale Period, the Activation Threshold is reached, but less than 156,250 Ether has been received by Company, no additional BAT will be sold.</p>

<h3 id="3-bat-price">3. BAT Price</h3>
<p>1 Ether will purchase 6,400 BAT, making the sale price of BAT 0.00015625 Ether per BAT.  There is no sale price for Company BAT, which is created by the Smart Contract System and pre-allocated to the Company before the Sale Period.</p>

<h3 id="4-procedures-for-buying-and-receiving-bat">4. Procedures for Buying and Receiving BAT</h3>
<p>In order to purchase BAT during the Sale Period, and to receive the BAT you purchase, you must have an Ethereum wallet that supports the ERC20 token standard.  Company reserves the right to prescribe additional wallet requirements. Approximately forty-eight (48) hours prior to the commencement of the Sale Period, Company will publish an address for the BAT sale via <a href="http://www.basicattentiontoken.org">www.basicattentiontoken.org</a>. To initiate a purchase of BAT during the Sale Period, you must send an amount of Ether to an Ethereum address (the &quot;BAToken Address&quot;) that will be provided to you only after you agree to these Terms by clicking the &quot;I Agree with the Terms – View the BAToken Address&quot; button at the bottom of these Terms.  Sending Ether to the BAToken Address during the Sale Period triggers a smart contract operation, pursuant to which the Smart Contract System will automatically create and promptly deliver the corresponding BAT to the ERC20 wallet address from which the Ether were sent. Ether must be sent to the BAToken Address during the Sale Period in order to purchase and receive BAT.  Sending Ether to any other address may result in loss of Ether.  Attempted transactions to purchase BAT will be rejected if Ether is sent to the BAToken Address at any time before or after the Sale Period. The Smart Contract System is deployed by Company from the Cayman Islands, and is programmed so that all transactions it executes will be executed in the Cayman Islands. As such, title to, and risk of loss of, BAT created and delivered by the Smart Contract System passes from Company to purchasers in the Cayman Islands.</p>

<h3 id="5-company-bat-and-user-growth-fund">5. Company BAT and User Growth Fund</h3>
<p>Of the Company BAT, 200 million BAT will be used for compensating employees and contractors, and for other internal purposes in connection with the deployment and the development of the Platform. The remaining 300 million BAT of the Company BAT will be allocated to a &quot;User Growth Fund&quot;, which we will administer to incentivize use of the Platform. The User Growth Fund is intended to reward early users of the Platform at up to 5 BAT per user. BAT received as a reward can only be used for transactions on the Platform. Any BAT from the User Growth Fund that is not transacted by a user on the Platform within six months of receipt will be sent back to the User Growth Fund to reward new users. Once the User Growth Fund is exhausted, it will be discontinued, and no new BAT will be created for or transferred to the User Growth Fund.</p>

<h3 id="6use-of-proceeds-from-bat-token-sale">6.Use of Proceeds from BAT Token Sale</h3>
<p>The Ether that Company receives for BAT sold to purchasers during the Sale Period, up to 156,250 Ether, will be used to compensate engineers, staff and contractors, cover operating costs and marketing expenses, and to address other administrative and unforeseen costs. The following is an estimated, illustrative allocation of these budget items, which Company reserves the right to modify in its sole and absolute discretion:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Technical Development and Staff (estimated 58% of proceeds).</em>
<ul>
<li>This budget item will support Company's team of over 20 engineers who are developing the Platform and making necessary adjustments to the development of the existing Brave solution and related technology.</li>

<h2 id="exhibit-c-certain-risks-relating-to-purchase-sale-and-use-of-bat">Exhibit C Certain Risks Relating to Purchase, Sale and Use of BAT</h2>
<p>** Important Note:**  As noted elsewhere in these Terms, the BAT are not being structured or sold as securities or any other form of investment product.  Accordingly, none of the information presented in this <strong>Exhibit C</strong> is intended to form the basis for any investment decision, and no specific recommendations are intended. Company expressly disclaims any and all responsibility for any direct or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever arising directly or indirectly from: (i) reliance on any information contained in this Exhibit C, (ii) any error, omission or inaccuracy in any such information or (iii) any action resulting from such information.</p>
<p><strong>By purchasing, holding and using BAT, you expressly acknowledge and assume the following risks:</strong></p>

<h3 id="1-risk-of-losing-access-to-bat-due-to-loss-of-private-keys-custodial-error-or-purchaser-error">1. Risk of Losing Access to BAT Due to Loss of Private Key(s), Custodial Error or Purchaser Error</h3>
<p>A private key, or a combination of private keys, is necessary to control and dispose of BAT stored in your digital wallet or vault.  Accordingly, loss of requisite private key(s) associated with your digital wallet or vault storing BAT will result in loss of such BAT.  Moreover, any third party that gains access to such private key(s), including by gaining access to login credentials of a digital wallet or vault service you use, may be able to misappropriate your BAT.  Any errors or malfunctions caused by or otherwise related to the digital wallet or vault you choose to receive and store BAT, including your own failure to properly maintain or use such digital wallet or vault, may also result in the loss of your BAT.  Additionally, your failure to follow precisely the procedures set forth in Section 4 of <strong>Exhibit B</strong> for buying and receiving BAT, including, for instance, if you provide the wrong address for receiving BAT, may result in the loss of your BAT.</p>

<h3 id="2-risks-associated-with-the-ethereum-protocol">2. Risks Associated with the Ethereum Protocol</h3>
<p>Because BAT and the Platform are based on the Ethereum protocol, any malfunction, breakdown or abandonment of the Ethereum protocol may have a material adverse effect on the Platform or BAT.  Moreover, advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computing, could present risks to BAT and the Platform, including the utility of BAT for obtaining Services, by rendering ineffective the cryptographic consensus mechanism that underpins the Ethereum protocol.</p>

<h3 id="3-risk-of-mining-attacks">3. Risk of Mining Attacks</h3>
<p>As with other decentralized cryptographic tokens based on the Ethereum protocol, BAT are susceptible to attacks by miners in the course of validating BAT transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, including, but not limited, to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, and selfish-mining attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the Platform and BAT, including, but not limited to, accurate execution and recording of transactions involving BAT.</p>

<h3 id="4-risk-of-hacking-and-security-weaknesses">4. Risk of Hacking and Security Weaknesses</h3>
<p>Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the Platform or BAT in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing.  Furthermore, because the Platform is based on open-source software, there is a risk that a third party or a member of the Company team may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the core infrastructure of the Platform, which could negatively affect the Platform and BAT, including BAT's utility for obtaining Services.</p>

<h3 id="5-risks-associated-with-markets-for-bat">5. Risks Associated with Markets for BAT</h3>
<p>BAT are intended to be used solely on the Platform, and Company will not support or otherwise facilitate any secondary trading or external valuation of BAT.  This restricts the contemplated avenues for using BAT to obtain Services or access the Platform, and could therefore create illiquidity risk with respect to BAT you hold.  Even if secondary trading of BAT is facilitated by third party exchanges, such exchanges may be relatively new and subject to little or no regulatory oversight, making them more susceptible to market-related risks.  Furthermore, to the extent that third-parties do ascribe an external exchange value to BAT (e.g., as denominated in a digital or fiat currency), such value may be extremely volatile and diminish to zero.</p>

<h3 id="6-risk-of-uninsured-losses">6. Risk of Uninsured Losses</h3>
<p>Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions, BAT are uninsured unless you specifically obtain private insurance to insure them.  Thus, in the event of loss or loss of utility value, there is no public insurer, such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or private insurance arranged by us, to offer recourse to you.</p>

<h3 id="7-risks-associated-with-uncertain-regulations-and-enforcement-actions">7. Risks Associated with Uncertain Regulations and Enforcement Actions</h3>
<p>The regulatory status of BAT and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions.  It is difficult to predict how or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulation with respect to such technology and its applications.  It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether legislatures or regulatory agencies may implement changes to law and regulation affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications, including the Platform and BAT. Regulatory actions could negatively impact the Platform and BAT in various ways, including, for purposes of illustration only, through a determination that BAT are a regulated financial instrument that require registration or licensing.  Company may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction.</p>

<h3 id="8-risks-arising-from-taxation">8. Risks Arising from Taxation</h3>
<p>The tax characterization of BAT is uncertain.  You must seek your own tax advice in connection with purchasing BAT, which may result in adverse tax consequences to you, including withholding taxes, income taxes and tax reporting requirements.</p>

<h3 id="9-risk-of-alternative-platforms">9. Risk of Alternative Platforms</h3>
<p>It is possible that alternative platforms could be established that utilize the same open source code and protocol underlying the Platform and attempt to facilitate services that are materially similar to the Services. The Platform may compete with these alternative platforms, which could negatively impact the Platform and BAT, including BAT's utility for obtaining Services.</p>

<h3 id="10-risk-of-insufficient-interest-in-the-platform-or-distributed-applications">10. Risk of Insufficient Interest in the Platform or Distributed Applications</h3>
<p>It is possible that the Platform will not be used by a large number of individuals, companies and other entities or that there will be limited public interest in the creation and development of distributed platforms (such as the Platform) more generally. Such a lack of use or interest could negatively impact the development of the Platform and the potential utility of BAT, including its utility for obtaining Services.</p>

<h3 id="11-risks-associated-with-the-development-and-maintenance-of-the-platform">11. Risks Associated with the Development and Maintenance of the Platform</h3>
<p>The Platform is still under development and may undergo significant changes over time. Although we intend for BAT and the Platform to follow the specifications set forth in <strong>Exhibit A</strong>, and will take commercially reasonable steps toward those ends, we may have to make changes to the specifications of BAT or the Platform for any number of legitimate reasons.  This could create the risk that BAT or the Platform, as further developed and maintained, may not meet your expectations at the time of purchasing BAT.  Furthermore, despite our good faith efforts to develop and maintain the Platform, it is still possible that the Platform will experience malfunctions or otherwise fail to be adequately developed or maintained, which may negatively impact the Platform and the potential utility of BAT, including its utility for obtaining Services.</p>

<h3 id="12-risk-of-an-unfavorable-fluctuation-of-ether-and-other-currency-value">12. Risk of an Unfavorable Fluctuation of Ether and Other Currency Value</h3>
<p>The Company team intends to use the proceeds from selling BAT to fund the maintenance and development of the Platform, as described further in Section 6 of <strong>Exhibit B</strong>. The proceeds of the sale of BAT will be denominated in Ether, and may, at our discretion, be converted into other cryptographic and fiat currencies. If the value of Ether or other currencies fluctuates unfavorably during or after the Sale Period, the Company team may not be able to fund development, or may not be able to develop or maintain the Platform in the manner that it intended.</p>

<h3 id="13-risk-of-dissolution-of-the-company">13. Risk of Dissolution of the Company</h3>
<p>It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, an unfavorable fluctuation in the value of Ether (or other cryptographic and fiat currencies), decrease in BAT's utility (including its utility for obtaining Services), the failure of commercial relationships, or intellectual property ownership challenges, the Platform may no longer be viable to operate and the Company may dissolve.</p>

<h3 id="14-risks-arising-from-lack-of-governance-rights">14. Risks Arising from Lack of Governance Rights</h3>
<p>Because BAT confer no governance rights of any kind with respect to the Platform or Company, all decisions involving the Platform or Company will be made by Company at its sole discretion, including, but not limited to, decisions to discontinue the Platform, to sell more BAT for use in the Platform, or to sell or liquidate the Company.  These decisions could adversely affect the Platform and the utility of BAT that you hold, including BAT's utility for obtaining Services.</p>

<h3 id="15-risks-associated-with-advertising-supported-business-models">15. Risks Associated with Advertising-Supported Business Models</h3>
<p>The Company's growth and adoption of the Platform may depend on our ability to maintain and expand our existing relationships with advertisers and publishers and our ability to develop new relationships with other advertisers and publishers within the Platform. As the advertising market generates and develops new concepts and technology, we may incur additional costs to implement a more effective Platform and may have to adjust to new tracking and unforeseeable technologies that could diminish the effectiveness of our BAM and other attention-measuring metrics. Continuing to develop and improve the Platform to keep up with these changes may require significant time and additional investment. If we cannot continue to develop and improve the Platform to maintain competitiveness in light of such changes, the Platform may not remain viable, which could negatively impact the utility of BAT, including BAT's utility for obtaining Services.</p>

<h3 id="16-risks-associated-with-new-and-evolving-laws-impacting-advertising-and-advertising-technology">16. Risks Associated with New and Evolving Laws Impacting Advertising and Advertising Technology</h3>
<p>The advertising and advertising technology ecosystems, and by extension our own Platform, are subject to a variety of federal, state and international laws and regulations, including those with respect to consumer privacy, data protection, consumer protection, content regulation, network neutrality, cyber security, data protection, intellectual property (including copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws), defamation, child protection, and others. These laws and regulations, and the interpretation or application of these laws and regulations, could change. In addition, new laws or regulations affecting the Company could be enacted. As the Platform evolves, Company may be subject to new laws and the application of existing laws to us might change. These laws and regulations are frequently costly to comply with and may divert a significant portion of Company's attention and resources. If we fail to comply with these applicable laws or regulations, we could receive negative publicity and be subject to significant liabilities which could adversely impact the Company, the Platform and BAT, including BAT's utility for obtaining Services. Additionally, the advertisers and publishers within the Platform are subject to industry specific laws and regulations or licensing requirements. If any of these parties fails to comply with any of these licensing requirements or other applicable laws or regulations, or if such laws and regulations or licensing requirements become more stringent or are otherwise expanded, it could adversely impact the Platform and BAT, including BAT's utility for obtaining Services.</p>

<h3 id="17-unanticipated-risks">17. Unanticipated Risks</h3>
<p>Cryptographic tokens such as BAT are a new and untested technology. In addition to the risks included in this <strong>Exhibit C</strong>, there are other risks associated with your purchase, holding and use of BAT, including those that the Company cannot anticipate. Such risks may further materialize as unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks discussed in this <strong>Exhibit C</strong>.</p>

The first explains a change in the BAT sale levels and the second outlines our approach to smart contracts.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[ Figures relating to &ldquo;Updated BAT Sale Levels&rdquo; may have changed. Please consult the <a href="/bat-sale-overview-and-how-to-participate/">current information</a>.]</strong></p>
<p>We are making two announcements today. The first explains a change in the BAT sale levels and the second outlines our approach to smart contracts.</p>

<h4 id="updated-bat-sale-levels">Updated BAT Sale Levels</h4>
<p>Since announcing the BAT sale, we have received tremendous support and interest. Both public and private communications have expressed genuine concern that the entire investment amount may be taken up quickly by large purchasers, leaving insufficient opportunity for smaller purchasers. We discussed this internally. Our conclusion was that by raising the cap and increasing the number of tokens, we could offer a better chance for smaller purchasers to participate.</p>
<p>At the same time, we analyzed what a higher cap could do for the success of the overall project. With additional proceeds from the sale of tokens, we could increase the size of the user growth pool, thus increasing the number of people who would be incentivized to partake in the new blockchain based digital ad platform. This would also allow us to hire more key engineering personnel, especially in blockchain, machine learning, and security. In addition, we plan to found and endow a non-profit trade association for attention apps, to co-develop emerging standards and smart contracts.</p>
<p>On the business side, additional sale proceeds would allow for focused international expansion, targeting China, India, and Japan — as well as the United States and Europe. As such, a higher cap offers greater purchaser opportunity while giving the company and token users a higher likelihood of success.</p>
<p>For these reasons we are making the following changes: [ <strong>Please consult the <a href="/bat-sale-overview-and-how-to-participate/">current information</a></strong> ]</p>
<ul>
<li>We are raising the cap to $24 million from $15 million.</li>
<li>The cap for the number of tokens is moving to 1.5 billion from 1 billion.</li>
<li>The number of tokens to be sold in the token sale is increasing to 1 billion from 700 million, an increase of nearly 43%.</li>
<li>The user growth pool is increasing to 300 million tokens from 100 million tokens or 20% of all tokens, an increase of 200% in the number of user growth tokens.</li>
<li>The tokens set aside in the BAT development pool will remain at 200 million tokens, a reduction to 13% from 20%.
Our next announcement will provide instructions on how to participate in the token sale.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="bat-contract-approach">BAT Contract Approach</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/brave-intl/basic-attention-token-crowdsale/tree/master/contracts">BAT smart contract</a> emphasis is on legibility and simplicity. Inspirations for the BAT smart contract were Golem and Firstblood.</p>
<p>We considered a number of existing frameworks. Some are helpful in code abstraction. However, the existing frameworks often change. They also do not add to legibility, as they require familiarity with a given git checkin of a given framework. We certainly envision that when the frameworks transition into something resembling a standard library, our opinion may change.</p>
<p>In our approach, we also avoided modifiers. Modifiers are pleasant syntactic sugar, which improve flow for developers. However, readability is not improved if more than one is added or if a modifier with complicated conditions is included. Consequently, all <a href="https://github.com/brave-intl/basic-attention-token-crowdsale/blob/master/contracts/BAToken.sol">BAT smart contract</a> functions have explicit conditionals. We also tried to use <a href="https://github.com/brave-intl/basic-attention-token-crowdsale/blob/master/contracts/SafeMath.sol">SafeMath.sol</a> wherever appropriate, something that should be part of the Solidity or any future smart contract language.</p>
<p>The BAT smart contract is also extremely democratic. Only one function is owned by Brave Software International, Ltd.: the <a href="https://github.com/brave-intl/basic-attention-token-crowdsale/blob/master/contracts/BAToken.sol#L66">one for finalizing</a> the token sale. This is required for legal and accounting purposes.</p>
<p>Another democratic aspect of our contract is the use of <a href="https://github.com/brave-intl/basic-attention-token-crowdsale/blob/master/contracts/BAToken.sol#L19">blocknumbers</a> instead of times to start the token sale. This will be a best effort estimate as block mining is presently 15.9s on average. We opted for blocknumbers even though they add some randomness to token sale start times. That concern was overridden by the fact that clocks can be manipulated.</p>
<p>Token sale participants are no doubt most interested in the contract functionality concerning the creation of tokens. This is the part of the contract with which token buyers will interact. When <em><strong>fundingStartBlock</strong></em> is reached, participants can send ETH to the <em><a href="https://github.com/brave-intl/basic-attention-token-crowdsale/blob/master/contracts/BAToken.sol#L49"><strong>CreateTokens</strong></a></em> function in the contract and it credits freshly minted BAT. The exchange rate should not be considered final until the contract is pushed to Ethereum 3 days before the crowdsale start. It will be published along with the address and a finalized set of terms and conditions. We do this because of the volatility in ETH, and we want to provide as accurate an exchange rate as possible.</p>
<p>The creation of the pool of BAT to fund user growth and for BAT development happens <a href="https://github.com/brave-intl/basic-attention-token-crowdsale/blob/master/contracts/BAToken.sol#L44">before</a> the token sale. The sequence was set for legal and accounting reasons. The BAT development pool will use a six-month <a href="https://github.com/brave-intl/basic-attention-token-crowdsale/blob/master/contracts/BATSafe.sol">lockup smart contract</a>. The user growth pool will remain unlocked, and will be used to fuel the growth of the BAT ecosystem.</p>
<p>The BAT smart contract has been subject to several audits and reviews, including those conducted by <a href="https://medium.com/zeppelin-blog/basic-attention-token-bat-audit-88bf196df64b">Zepplin</a>, <a href="http://dapphub.com/">Dapphub</a>, and Will Warren from <a href="https://0xproject.com/">0x</a>.</p>
<p>In the event we do not sell our lower limit of funding within the 30 day limit, then participants will be given the opportunity to get a refund for their BAT. Brave will be unable to withdraw any ETH in this case.</p>

<p>The Basic Attention Token sale will begin on Wednesday, May 31, 2017, at approximately 8 am PDT / 3 pm GMT / 11 pm CT-China. The sale will last up to 30 days or until the cap of the equivalent in $15 million in ETH (fixed at contract push) is sold. The sale of tokens is capped at 1 billion. We do not plan to have a follow-on offering.</p>
<p>At that time of the sale, we will deploy the contract to the Ethereum network. The contract address will be revealed 2 days before the commencement of the sale. The exact time of the sale is subject to a block number. That number will be announced as soon as we deploy it to the Ethereum mainnet. Approximately one week before we share the contract address we will make the contract available on the testnet for anyone to review.</p>
<p>We will soon be announcing more details concerning the token sale, including how to participate.</p>

Please consult the <a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/bat-crowdsale-overview-and-how-to-participate/">current information</a>.]</strong></p>
<p>We recently announced that the BAT distribution will include a “user growth pool.” Today, we are providing more details about how the user pool will help drive adoption. In addition, we are offering further information on how BAT use will find application beyond digital advertising and how the platform will extend well into other “attention-based” platforms beyond the Brave browser.</p>
<p>An integral part of the BAT token sale is the creation of a user pool, which, we mentioned last week will consist of 10% of the token total in the event of a sell out. There are currently 100 million tokens in the user pool. These tokens will be used to incentivize users to join the BAT ecosystem. We anticipate that when users download the Brave browser they will be rewarded with up to 5 tokens. The final number will be influenced by pricing. Potentially, this could prompt as many as 50 million users to join the BAT ecosystem.</p>
<p>These tokens given as an incentive to download the Brave browser will be usable only within the BAT ecosystem. Any BATs not used by users for a specified amount of time (to be decided) will be returned to the pool. Once the user growth pool is exhausted, we do not plan on adding any more tokens.</p>
<p>Once in the system, users will be able to obtain services and gain and spend BAT in a number of different scenarios. Users will be able to use BAT in exchange for premium content from publishers. Users will also be able to donate BAT to publishers whose ads they are blocking. The Brave browser already has a donation system in beta. Publishers could also incentivize users to download their app with BAT. We are confident there are many other services and use cases that will surface as the ecosystem comes to life.</p>
<p>We also envision a number of ways in which the BAT will extend beyond its initial base, the Brave browser. We will build the BAT platform on top of the Brave browser, but this is just one interface for BAT. As we develop the BAT protocol, we envision developers coming up with new and novel interfaces for BAT.</p>
<p>Some of these could include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Other browser extensions: One obvious use case for the BAT is for it to be used inside other browsers through extensions. This means that the BAT ecosystem will extend out to anyone using any of the current popular browsers.</li>
<li>Telegram bot: In messaging apps like Telegram, we foresee the possibility of users being paid in BAT to view one ad.</li>
<li>WeChat official account: WeChat has become a robust system of bots, payments, and other solutions. We foresee the creation of different WeChat solutions integrating the BAT.</li>
<li>Token and Status: The BAT also has attention-based applicability inside the Ethereum-based messaging/payment platforms such as Coinbase’s new Token app and Status app.</li>
</ul>
<p>These apps and extensions must be fraud-resistant if they are to participate in BAT-based token flows such as private/anonymous ad revenue shares. Therefore, depending on the success of the token sale, we intend to found a non-profit trade association of attention-based apps and extensions, precisely to develop common standards and auditing requirements for endpoint software that integrates with the BAT ecosystem.</p>
<p>We’ll be sharing the date and time of the token sale soon, but meanwhile, to remain notified of the latest updates, please sign up for our newsletter via our <a href="/">homepage</a> if you have not done so already.

Please consult the <a href="/blog/bat-sale-overview-and-how-to-participate/">current information</a>.]</strong></p>
<p>Today, we are announcing the amount, distribution and use of proceeds from the upcoming Basic Attention Token (BAT) sale.</p>
<p>In the upcoming BAT sale, we are targeting sale proceeds of as much as $15 million and a cap of 1 billion tokens. We do not plan to have a follow-on offering.</p>
<p>As we near the sale, we will provide specific instructions on how to participate, including how you will need to send Ethereum (ETH) to a smart contract at an address that we will disclose.</p>
<p>In the token sale, we plan to distribute tokens in the following proportion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tokens available for token sale: 70%</li>
<li>The BAT development: 20%</li>
<li>User growth pool: 10%</li>
</ul>
<p>The token distribution covers the phased release of software previously described in the white paper. The first phase involves the roll-out of a new browser, Brave, a fast, open source, privacy-focused browser that blocks ads and trackers, and contains an opt-in ledger system that measures user attention — without violating privacy — to accurately reward publishers. The next phase involves the introduction of BAT, which will be used to compensate publishers for user attention, or focused mental engagement.</p>
<p>Part of the token distribution will be given to Brave browser users to incentivize them to join the new blockchain-based system. A certain number of users will receive BATs for downloading the Brave browser. Users will be able to spend these tokens for regular or premium content, or they can donate them back to their favorite publishers.</p>
<p>The bulk of the Ethereum proceeds from the token sale (the 70%) will be used to support the development and growth of the BAT ecosystem, which includes the Ethereum-based smart contract system and the Brave browser. It is important to note that the Brave browser is just one platform for BAT and our goal is to lay the foundation so that other developers can build other apps in the BAT ecosystem. The vision is that BAT will be used across the web to reward producers for great content in new and innovative ways.</p>
<p>Here is a more detailed breakdown of how we plan to spend the proceeds we receive. 20% of BAT created during token sale (in addition to ETH raised) will be used for development, marketing, operations, and other costs:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>BAT Development 58% of budget</strong>: The team consists of just over 20 engineers. This financing allows for the rollout of the BAT solution, including the necessary adjustments to and development of the existing Brave browser technology.</li>
<li><strong>Contingency 7% of budget</strong>: This is a set-aside to plan for unforeseen costs.</li>
<li><strong>Marketing 12% of budget</strong>: Marketing will focus on expanding awareness and adoption of the Brave browser and the BAT solution among users, publishers and advertisers. This also includes the growth and maintenance of the world-wide community.</li>
<li><strong>Contractors 13% of budget</strong>: These proceeds will be directed at third-party providers offering engineering, marketing, growth-hacking, PR, partnerships, affiliate programs and more.
Administration 10% of budget: Consists of BAT legal, security, accounting and other associated administration costs.</li>

The <a href="/">Basic Attention Token</a> (BAT) seeks to radically reduce digital ad fraud, which is estimated to be $16B in 2017, according to a report released a few weeks ago by the World Federation of Advertisers. The sheer number of middlemen present in the ad-tech ecosystem inevitably creates entry points for fraud to flourish. Publishers do not accurately know what ads are programmatically served to their ad slots. All of this is part of what recently prompted <a href="http://adage.com/article/media/p-g-s-pritchard-calls-digital-grow-up-new-rules/307742/">P&amp;G’s Chief Brand Officer Marc Pritchard</a> to say: “The days of giving digital a pass are over. It’s time to grow up. It’s time for action.”</p>

<h4 id="the-industry-faces-a-huge-fraud-problem-with-no-relief-in-sight">The industry faces a huge fraud problem with no relief in sight:</h4>
<ul>
<li>The World Federation of Advertisers predicts that <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/wfa-report-ad-fraud-will-cost-advertisers-50-billion-by-2025-2016-6">ad fraud will cost advertisers $50B by 2025</a>, describing the malpractice as an organized crime “second only to the drugs trade.”</li>
<li>In December 2016, ad-fraud detection company White Ops exposed <a href="https://www.humansecurity.com/blog/methbot-then-and-now">Methbot</a>, an ad fraud scam that allegedly <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/methbot-ad-fraud-russian-white-ops-2016-12">cost advertisers up to $5M a day</a>.</li>
<li>A study conducted by <a href="http://www.theandpartnership.com/">The&amp;Partnership</a> and <a href="http://adloox.com/">Adloox</a> estimates that nearly 20% of total digital ad spend in 2016 ($12.48B) was wasted due to fraudulent ad placements.</li>
<li>Estimated fraud for 2017 has more than doubled in comparison to the <a href="http://adage.com/article/digital/ana-report-7-2-billion-lost-ad-fraud-2015/302201/">Association of National Advertisers $7.2B fraud estimates for 2016</a>.</li>

Recent incidents demonstrate that some of the largest players in the space are not immune:</h4>
<ul>
<li>In January 2016, <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2016/01/07/yahoos-troubled-advertising-business.html">CNBC reported</a> that Yahoo was allegedly not serving ads to 30–70% of the locations that they had claimed. Instead of pre-roll video ads being served to the video player placements that demand $20 CPM (cost per thousand views), sources reported that Yahoo was allegedly serving the video ads in smaller $2–4 CPM display ad slots that run alongside video players.</li>
<li>In September 2016, the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-overestimated-key-video-metric-for-two-years-1474586951?utm_source=API+Need+to+Know+newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=75c17a8d4d-Need_to_Know_September_23_20169_23_2016&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_e3bf78af04-75c17a8d4d-45802893">Wall Street Journal</a> reported that <a href="http://www.marketingdive.com/news/facebook-inflated-video-ad-metrics-for-last-two-years/426934/">Facebook had been overstating video ad metrics</a> by an estimated 60–80% for two years, resulting in a <a href="http://www.marketingdive.com/news/facebook-faces-class-action-suit-over-inflated-video-metrics/429548/">class action lawsuit</a>.</li>
<li>In January 2016, Google was exposed by <a href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2016/01/clickjacking-campaign-plays-on-european-cookie-law/">MalwareBytes</a> as having their ad network abused by a fraud operation that targeted European users using layered ad injection that displayed fraudulent cookie disclosure notifications.</li>
<li>In March 2017, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/business/chase-ads-youtube-fake-news-offensive-videos.html">New York Times</a> reported that JP Morgan Chase scaled back their ad delivery from 400,000 sites to a whitelist of 5,000 sites, and surprisingly saw little to no change in the cost of ad impressions or visibility.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="what-does-the-ad-industry-propose-for-addressing-the-issue">What does the ad industry propose for addressing the issue?</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://tagtoday.net/aboutus/">Trustworthy Accountability Group</a> (TAG) is a cross-industry accountability program fighting criminal activity across the digital advertising supply chain. Founded by the American Association of Advertising Agencies (4A’s), Association of National Advertisers (ANA), and Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB), the TAG Certified Against Fraud Program Guidelines are often cited in fraud reports as the ad industry’s response to fraud. The blind spots in these guidelines are obvious:</p>
<ul>
<li>Participants are required to pay annual fees to participate.</li>
<li>Self-certification is an acceptable method for participants, with third party certification being strongly encouraged but not mandated.</li>
<li>No requirements are made for the resources needed to support Certified Against Fraud compliance aside from the requirements that certified companies always have a designated TAG Compliance Officer.</li>
<li>There are no mentions of user privacy, or signs of privacy protection by design, in the guidelines.</li>
<li>The TAG Certified Against Fraud Program does not account for fraud occurring outside its purview.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="bat-radically-reducing-fraud-empowering-the-parties-that-matter">BAT: Radically reducing fraud, empowering the parties that matter.</h4>
<p>The system needs major change, not minor rearrangements or additional moving parts. Half-measures will not make a substantial impact. That is why we created the Basic Attention Token (BAT). It creates a platform for a new deal to take place between publishers, advertisers and users. It prices users in from the start and along the way. The BAT underpins more efficient economics relationships, realistically addresses fraud, and protects user privacy.</p>

<ul>
<li>BAT protects against fraud by eliminating third-party traffic sourcing, which the <a href="https://www.ana.net/getfile/23332">2015 White Ops &amp; ANA Baseline Bot Study</a> concluded was more than three times as likely to contain bots than unsourced traffic. This ability will substantially reduce the fraud outlined in the aforementioned reports. Also, by reducing middlemen, BAT eliminates the fees, latency and additional round trips in the ad-serving process. This means fewer ads and trackers, thus a much better user experience, with better economics for users, advertisers, and publishers.</li>
<li>BAT’s Basic Attention Metrics (BAM) system removes fraud entry points. BAM will measure the user’s direct attention and engagement on the mobile and desktop browser or other BAT-enabled app. This measurement data will be private, because it is not transmitted across the network. By measuring directly on the device, BAM will greatly reduce cross-platform discrepancies that have <a href="http://measurementnow.net/press-release-media-rating-council-announces-summary-of-results-of-phase-3-of-viewable-impression-reconciliation-testing/">become common among MRC Accredited 3rd parties</a>. <a href="http://measurementnow.net/press-release-media-rating-council-announces-summary-of-results-of-phase-3-of-viewable-impression-reconciliation-testing/">These 3rd parties</a> apply their own methods (some of which rely on Flash, a deprecated and insecure plugin) for measuring “viewability.” By keeping user data on-device, BAM measurements also avoid the privacy problems of ISP and other 3rd party interception associated with transmitting user data over the Internet. Equally important, the BAM will improve reporting of ads viewed to substantially reduce the over-reporting of this data by companies.</li>
<li>Fraud hides in the intentional opacity of existing ad-tech. Transparency is a vital component of any legitimate ad ecosystem. To ensure the integrity of the platform for brands and users, BAT code will be auditable as open source. Further, the public and decentralized nature of the blockchain ensures that macro-economic and eventually anonymous transactions will be auditable. basicattentiontoken.org will develop no-exception rules against remote tracking and third-party ads that depend on tracking for campaign measurement. This is necessary to avoid arbitrage and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham%27s_law">Gresham’s law</a> problems.</li>
<li>Only the user with the aid of BAT-enabled apps mediates between advertisers and publishers, so <a href="http://go.whiteops.com/rs/179-SQE-823/images/WO_Methbot_Operation_WP.pdf">third-party invalid traffic and other fraud detection bypassed by bots</a> will be excluded from the start. Private ad impressions and actions will be verifiable using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof">Zero-Knowledge Proof</a> (ZKP) protocols such as <a href="https://anonize.org/">Anonize</a> (already used by the Brave browser for its opt-in micro-donation service).</li>
<li>Personalized ads will be placed based only on app- and device-local data and analytics that consult a common downloaded inventory catalog. This reduces vulnerabilities to threats such as as <a href="http://blog.ezanga.com/blog/fighting-ad-injection-what-you-need-to-know">fraudulent layered ad injection</a> mentioned in the cookie disclosure example above.</li>
<li>Ads and payouts will be rate limited, making bot operations hard to deploy at scale.</li>
</ul>
<p>This list gives some of our founding operational principles and how they can be implemented to create an open, verifiable direct ad delivery and measurement platform. Ads are guaranteed viewable with BAM, verified via ZKP protocols, and bot fraud restricted by payments being rate limited to known publishers only. Based on feedback from users, advertisers, and publishers, we will develop detailed specifications in consultation among the members of the basicattentiontoken.org group.</p>
<p>The goal is to ensure real users view authentic, ads while protecting users’ data performance, privacy, and safety. This is what the ad industry has failed to bring about in almost two decades (studies on fraud in digital advertising began to call attention to this problem <a href="http://www.id.uzh.ch/home/mazzo/reports/www8conf/2149/pdf/pd1.pdf">as early as 1999</a>). Ad fraud takes more and more from overall ad spend; it has broken trust among all parties in the current indirect ad delivery model. Some ad industry solutions contemplate adding more middlemen to the system, but more layers will not solve the problem.</p>
<p>Digital advertising needs a new deal, where ad fraud is not considered a “cost of doing business.” BAT will provide the token of utility and decentralized platform to uphold the terms of this new deal.</p>

<p>The existing digital advertising marketplace injures key stakeholders. The introduction of BAT allows publishers, advertisers, and users to connect in a more efficient, transparent and decentralized marketplace that reduces fraud, privacy violations, and malvertisements while increasing publisher revenue.</p>
<p>BATs are based on user attention, which is really just focused mental engagement, and can be used to obtain advertising and other attention-based services on the BAT platform. BATs will be made available for crowdsale in the near future.</p>

<p>The advertising ecosystem started out as a marketplace where publishers, advertisers, and users were the main actors, but it is now overrun by “middleman” ad exchanges, complicated behavioral and cross-device user tracking, and opaque cross-party sharing through data management platforms.</p>
<p>This has translated into advertisers facing poor reporting and targeting, and publishers losing billions in revenue — while fraud has skyrocketed. Users have lost their privacy, face increasing malware risks, pay high charges to download trackers and ads, and suffer slow speeds. This has driven the adoption of ad blocking software, which is now on over 600 million mobile devices and desktops.</p>
<p>A few key numbers tell the story of today’s broken digital advertising landscape:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over the last 12 years, publishers have lost approximately 66% of their revenue.</li>
<li>In 2016, ad fraud created by Internet bots cost advertisers $7.2 billion, up from $6.3 billion in 2015.</li>
<li>Up to 50% of the average user’s mobile data is used for ads and trackers, costing up to $23 a month.</li>
<li>Users face slow page loads and as much as 21% less battery life.</li>
<li>Google and Facebook, which together claim 73% of digital ad revenue and 99% of all growth, are exacerbating the crisis.</li>
</ul>
<p>Presently, publishers are paid by monetizing attention via a complex network of intermediary players through ad networks and other such tools. With the onslaught of parasitic actors, publishers are getting very little revenue.</p>
<p>A new system is needed to properly value user attention. It must reward and protect the user, while giving better conversion to advertisers and higher yield to publishers.</p>

<h4 id="fairness-anonymity-and-impact-using-proven-blockchain-technology">Fairness, anonymity, and impact using proven blockchain technology</h4>
<p>In the new blockchain-based digital advertising platform, users will opt in to receive advertising. If they do, their attention will be privately monitored on-device in the Brave browser, without tracking. Publishers will be rewarded accordingly with BATs — tokens of utility in a secure, private, and anonymous advertising system based in the browser and the mobile app webview. Users will also get a share of BATs for participating.</p>
<p>By keeping the data on the device, encrypting the data, and shielding the identities of our users as a core principle, BAT forms a bond with users that proves that not only does their data hold value, it holds substantial value that has been ignored and exploited by the middlemen year after year in the current industry model.</p>
<p>In sum, the BAT system provides the following benefits to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users: strong privacy and security when viewing advertisements, improved relevance and performance, and a share of tokens.</li>
<li>Publishers: improved revenue, better reporting, and less fraud.</li>
<li>Advertisers: less expensive customer attention, less fraud, and better attribution.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="anonymous-machine-learning-for-relevance-open-source-for-transparency">Anonymous machine learning for relevance; open source for transparency</h4>
<p>In early stages, the BAT will be specifically tied to Brave browsers and Brave servers, along with verified publishers. Ad fraud will be reduced by publication of all source code for auditing, and by cryptographically secure transactions. Publisher payment will be through the BAT system.</p>
<p>The BAT exchange will be rolled out in phases over the coming months:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pre-1.0 BAT: Brave already has an anonymized ledger system for making donations and payments to publishers based on user attention. The secure vault using the ANONIZE algorithm to ensure customer privacy is an important piece of the BAT ecosystem which is already in place and deployed in Brave. Brave is already measuring user attention at the browser and distributing donations to the publishers using this system.</li>
<li>1.0 BAT: BAT wallet integrated with the Brave browser. Verification and transactions to be handled by Brave’s internal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof">Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP)</a> ledger system to protect individual user anonymity from advertisers, publishers and third parties. Ad inventory will be valued, and transactions will be calculated from reported Basic Attention Metric (BAM) data.</li>
<li>Beyond 1.0 BAT: Make the transfer and verification process entirely distributed on Ethereum using a state channel scheme with zero knowledge proof protocol for ensuring user privacy. Add alternate BAM metrics based on advertiser feedback. This will allow for full user privacy as well as a decentralized audit trail for advertisers, users and publishers to ensure they received correct payments for the advertising delivered through the BAT network.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Basic Attention Token is uniquely positioned to reform the ad-tech ecosystem because it is the ability to privately monitor and anonymously confirm user intent at the browser level which allows for the development of rich metrics for user attention. Attention is measured as viewed for content and ads only in the browser’s active tab in real time. The Attention Value for the ad will be calculated based on incremental duration and pixels in view in proportion to relevant content, prior to any direct engagement with the ad. We will define further anonymous cost-per-action models as the system develops.</p>
<p>For placement, Ads will be matched with user interests using local machine learning algorithms to judge the content to which the user is paying attention, in the context of tabs, viewability, and many other variables not available to remote trackers. This matching will be done privately, on the device only, without any signal out. This means fewer, but more relevant and valuable ads. Several scoring algorithms have been tried with the Brave donation ledger system, which automatically donates an amount proportional to the attention given to a website.</p>
<p>As Brave moves to a fully decentralized micropayment system, we expect other developers to use our free and open source infrastructure to develop their own use cases for BAT. We want BAT and the tools associated with it to become widely adopted web standards for future development of web content, solving the important problem of monetizing publisher content while protecting user privacy. Publishers, advertisers and users who view web content deserve a private, secure and well engineered future.</p>

            Please read the <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x0d8775f648430679a709e98d2b0cb6250d2887ef#code">BAT token contract</a> carefully before you begin implementing a smart contract that interacts with it. You should also read <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20">https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20</a> and note that tokens do NOT need to implement the items that say &ldquo;SHOULD&rdquo; in order to comply with the standard (but must implement items that say &ldquo;MUST&rdquo;). In particular, the BAT contract was deployed before the ERC-20 spec was changed to recommend throwing on invalid transfer/transferFrom calls. Instead, it returns false, as was suggested in the spec at the time of BAT&rsquo;s launch: <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20">github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20</a>.

            <p>We are building the BAT platform to integrate the Brave browser (see below), Brave’s ledger system, as well as a BAT wallet and related blockchain-attested functionality. The utility token is for conducting transactions and obtaining services on the platform. The token will be used, for example, in acquiring ad slots to be filled with privately matched, anonymously confirmed ads.<br /><br />Given the open-source nature of the project, however, we also envision that as we develop the BAT protocol, third-party developers may come up with new and novel uses for the token.<strong>Some of these could include:</strong></p>
<ul> <li>Other browsers: One obvious use case for the token is for it to be used inside other browsers. This means that the BAT ecosystem will extend out to anyone using any of the current popular browsers.</li> <li>Telegram bot: In messaging apps like Telegram, we foresee the possibility of users being paid in BAT to view one ad.</li> <li>WeChat official account: WeChat has become a robust system of bots, payments, and other solutions. We foresee the creation of different WeChat solutions integrating the the token.</li> <li>Token and Status: The BAT also has attention-based applicability inside the Ethereum-based messaging/payment platforms such as Coinbase’s new Token app and Status app.</li> </ul>
These apps must be fraud-resistant if they are to participate.

            Why generate a distinct token, as opposed to using Bitcoin?
        </h3>
        <div class="accordion__item-content">
            BAT is not a digital currency, it is a utility token. It can be used as a unit of account between advertisers, publishers, and users on the BAT platform, and can be utilized to directly measure, exchange, and verify attention. Bitcoin would not enable this distinct, in-platform problem solving. Also, an integral part of the token sale was the creation of the BAT user growth pool (UGP) of 300 million tokens, which will be used to incentivize users to join the BAT platform. Finally, using BAT on Ethereum allows for faster scalability than using Bitcoin.

BAT is also supported cross-chain via bridges, and has holders and utility on Binance BNB Chain, Polygon, Solana and others that support wrapped variations of ERC20 tokens. <a href="https://solscan.io/token/EPeUFDgHRxs9xxEPVaL6kfGQvCon7jmAWKVUHuux1Tpz">Brave officially supports Wormhole v2 SPL BAT on Solana</a>, but other variants are likely to emerge on multiple networks and secondary markets.

Uphold currently supports 34 countries, and Uphold reports that more are on the way.<br /><br />If your country isn’t on this list, here are some suggestions from Uphold on how to transfer funds from your Uphold account to a bank in your country.<br /><br />First, please make a request via Uphold to let them know that you’d like them to add support for your country. You can do that by filling out the support request form <a href='https://support.uphold.com/hc/en-us/requests/new'>here</a>. In your request, you should also ask them for a list of exchanges that do serve your country’s banking network.<br /><br />Next, with that information in hand, you can get an account with such an exchange, get a Bitcoin address for that account, and transfer your funds to that Bitcoin address. From there, you can transfer to your checking account. Note that both Uphold and the exchange you use will employ know-your-customer and anti-money-laundering procedures to verify the origin and destination of your funds.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there is a downside in terms of fees to this work-around.  Here’s an illustrative breakdown of the extra fees so that this process is transparent. Let’s say that you are Canadian, and you determine that the exchange connects to your banking network.<br /><br />First, Uphold charges a fee to convert from another currency to Bitcoin.  According to this <a href='https://uphold.com/en/pricing'>schedule</a>, the fee would be $2.99 (the withdrawal via crypto fee) plus 1.05% (the Bitcoin fee, which is higher than the USD fee of 0.65%).<br /><br />Second, the Bitcoin network will charge a transaction fee.<br /><br />Third, the destination exchange you select may charge you a fee.<br /><br />Finally, we would remind you that we are providing the above information for your convenience only, and that you are responsible for complying with applicable legal and regulatory requirements when using an exchange as described above.
